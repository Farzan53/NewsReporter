        <h3>Fresh In Balochistan: Emerging Young Artists' Work On Display In Quetta
        </h3>
        <p>Art is becoming a medium to express human feelings, and young artists in the capital of Balochistan province are exhibiting their theses for visitors before they embark on their professional careers. These artistic pieces on display in Quetta cover a range of themes including language, culture, mental health, recycling, climate change, wildlife, refugees, migrations, local culture suffocation, and species extinction. Young artists have been calling upon rulers, policymakers, and leaders to make decisions that secure a peaceful and loving environment, instead of fostering hatred, division, and otherisation. Balochistan boasts one of the largest levels of human diversity in the region, where different languages, cultures, ethnicities, and religious groups have coexisted since prehistoric times.

<h1>Bringing back the past</h1>

<p>
    he restoration of the houses of Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor in Peshawar is back in the news, as the funds sanctioned for the project have reportedly been released.
    
    Although there have long been gestures and good intentions regarding the cultural heritage of Peshawar – home to some of the most celebrated performers with immense following – it was during the 1990s, under the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, that significant attention was drawn to this legacy. At that time, the government decided to confer a civilian award on Dilip Kumar, which brought renewed focus to Peshawar’s cultural ancestry.
    
    This initiative also re-ignited discussions about the properties associated with these iconic film stars and the need for their restoration. However, it was not until the tenure of the Awami National Party government in the 2010s that concrete steps were taken to restore the homes of these legendary figures, marking them as symbols of pride for the city.
