        <h3>Pakistan’s political deadlock deepens as PTI withdraws from negotiations
        </h3>
        <p>Islamabad, Pakistan – Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party has decided to walk out of talks with the government aimed at defusing tensions that have dominated the country’s political landscape for the past three years, prompting fears of new street confrontations between the opposition party and law enforcement.

            After three rounds of talks, Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had placed the onus on the government to consider its charter of demands, which it presented during the last dialogue on January 16. However, a week later on Thursday, PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan announced that the party would withdraw from negotiations following instructions from Khan, who has been imprisoned since August 2023.

        <h3>The Cost of Democratic Overkill: Polarization and Power Struggles in Pakistan’s Politics
        </h3>
        <p> The specter of military intervention has long loomed over Pakistan’s political landscape. As the country faces growing political polarization and economic challenges, the question of whether the military will once again play a direct role in governance has become a pressing one. A firm belief of the current government in the military solution as a panacea to Pakistan’s poly-crises is becoming increasingly conspicuous, which is why the military’s omnipresence is evident whether it comes to civilian institutions, policymaking, and execution.
