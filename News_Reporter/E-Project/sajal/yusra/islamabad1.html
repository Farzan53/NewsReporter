    </h1>
<p>LAHORE: /DNA/ – On 1 January 2025, Rongvudhi Virabutr, Ambassador-designate of Thailand to Pakistan, along with Madam Bantita Pichyakorn Virabutr, met with Mrs. Nabila Irfan, Director of the Lahore Museum, to discuss fostering cultural and archaeological cooperation between the two nations.

    Both sides also discussed plans for an exhibition of Gandharan artifacts in Thailand scheduled for early 2026. The Royal Thai Embassy pledged full support to facilitate all preparations for the Exhibition. Ambassador is of the view that showcasing Gandharan artifacts in Thailand will be instrumental in deepening the knowledge and understanding of Gandhara’s rich heritage and its influence on Buddhist art, especially stone-carved Buddha imagery which occurred for the first time during Gandharan civilization. In addition of making Gandharan arts more known in wider circles since more than 35 million tourists visit Thailand, this initiative will also contribute to enhancing tourism to Pakistan’s Gandhara sites as well as boosting the economy for the local community.
