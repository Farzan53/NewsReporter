        <h3>IMF proposes CPP tariff alignment from Feb

        </h3>
        <p>
            SLAMABAD:
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed the alignment of gas tariffs for captive power plants (CPPs) with re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) prices, effective from February 1 this year.

Earlier, the government agreed with the IMF that gas supply to CPPs would be disconnected. The agreement came in the backdrop of supplies by public gas utilities to the inefficient gas-based power plants. These plants had not been receiving gas at discounted rates but they had been provided electricity from the national grid at cheaper prices.

In the past, the accountability court had also conducted an inquiry, terming gas supply to CPPs at cheaper rates a criminal offence while discouraging supplies to efficient power plants.

<h1>Pakistan seeks Swedish green fund assistance

</h1>
<p>ISLAMABAD:
    Federal Minister for Power Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari has invited Sweden Green Fund to assist in conversion of Pakistan's small vehicles into electric technology by providing technical and financial assistance, which will support Pakistan's recent record reduction in tariffs for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.
    
    The minister put forward the proposal in a meeting with Swedish Ambassador Alexandra Berg Von Linde on Thursday.
    
    Elaborating on the proposal for the conversion of existing fossil fuel vehicles, especially motorcycles, Leghari said that currently there were over 30 million motorcycles in Pakistan and people falling in that income group had a very good record of retiring loans.

    She highlighted that Swedish firms operating in Pakistan were keen on securing green energy supply and Sweden was ready to share expertise and provide technological support. The textile sector of Pakistan, being a primary exporter to the European Union, was focusing on growing its global competitiveness in terms of renewable and sustainable energy, the ambassador said. She underscored Sweden's leadership in renewable energy as it produced 70% of energy from renewable resources, showcasing how economic development and green energy could coexist seamlessly.
