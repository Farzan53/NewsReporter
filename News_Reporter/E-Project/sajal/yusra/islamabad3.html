        <h3>The Impact Of Female Politicians On Legislative Reforms In Pakistan
        </h3>
        <p>
            The history of women in politics in Pakistan is complex. Various Pakistani women have played important political roles over time, breaking barriers and pushing changes that not only addressed issues specific to women but also influenced the sociopolitical structure of the nation. Their contributions cover a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from international diplomacy and constitutional revisions to women's rights and education. Beyond various obstacles, including institutional, political, and cultural hurdles, their efforts have resulted in notable progress in fields like social welfare, human rights, and gender equality.

            Important personalities in Pakistan's initial years were Fatima Jinnah and Begum Rana Liaquat Ali Khan, who served the nation with their unbeatable efforts. Fatima Jinnah supported her brother's struggle for the freedom of Pakistan and worked for women's empowerment while Begum Rana Liaquat Ali Khan began the establishment of the All Pakistan Women's Association in 1949 in an effort to develop women's facilities for health care, education, and employment.

        <h3>Elements who dreamt of Pakistan's default can't digest progress

        </h3>
        <p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that the anti-Pakistan elements, who had dreamt of Pakistan’s default, continue to make repeated attempts to attack Islamabad.

            Talking to a delegation of Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) which called on him here, the prime minister said: “These elements are finding it difficult to digest Pakistan’s economic stability and development.
            
            “We have sacrificed our politics for Pakistan’s economic security, and will continue to work day and night for its development,” he added.</p>

        <h3>The Cost of Democratic Overkill: Polarization and Power Struggles in Pakistan’s Politics
        </h3>
        <p>
            The specter of military intervention has long loomed over Pakistan’s political landscape. As the country faces growing political polarization and economic challenges, the question of whether the military will once again play a direct role in governance has become a pressing one. A firm belief of the current government in the military solution as a panacea to Pakistan’s poly-crises is becoming increasingly conspicuous, which is why the military’s omnipresence is evident whether it comes to civilian institutions, policymaking, and execution.

<h1>Is Pakistan on the Brink of Another Political Showdown?
</h1>
<p>ISLAMABAD:
    The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) rally in Islamabad on Sunday has created a new round of controversy in Pakistan, sparking fears that political tensions in the country are set to explode.

At the rally, PTI leaders warned the government that they would free party chief and former Prime Minister Imran Khan if he wasn’t legally released from prison within two weeks. The party has also warned of serious consequences if the cases against Khan are taken to military courts.

Khan has been in prison since 2023 after being sentenced in a corruption case. Concerns are growing that he could be tried in military courts for his alleged involvement in inciting violent attacks on military installations on May 9 last year. In this regard, the ongoing military trial involving former spy chief Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed has added another layer of complexity to the country’s political landscape.

She underscored Sweden's leadership in renewable energy as it produced 70% of energy from renewable resources, showcasing how economic development and green energy could coexist seamlessly.
