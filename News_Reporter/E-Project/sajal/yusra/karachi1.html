        <h3>Health Minister denies Covid cases upsurge in Karachi
            
        </h3>
        <p>KARACHI: Sindh’s Health Minister Azra Pechuho has refuted reports with regard to an upsurge in Covid cases in Karachi, ARY News reported on Monday.

            “Don’t afraid, corona disease is not spreading in Karachi,” the health minister said. “Coronavirus has vanished across the world,” Pechuho said.
            
            Health minister also asked to avoid sensationalism with fake news.
            
            “As a precaution, common cold patients’ tests conducted and mild symptoms were detected in seven out of 100 patients,” minister said.
            
            “Corona has become like seasonal cold across the world, so there is nothing to be worried,” she advised citizens.
            
            Recently, reports revealed that Karachi has started to see a rise in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, with 25 to 30 percent of patients presenting with symptoms of cold and cough testing positive for the virus.
            
            According to Professor Saeed Khan, an expert in infectious diseases at Dow Hospital, there has been an increase in the number of people suffering from cold, cough, and fever in the city. After testing, 25 to 30 percent of these patients are confirmed to have COVID-19.

        <h3>In Sickness and in Debt: The Right to Health
            50% of Pakistanis Do Not Have Access to Basic Primary Healthcare Services, and Approximately 42% Have No Access to Health
        </h3>

            Muhammad Boota, a domestic worker in Lahore, requires an insulin injection every 10 days to help manage his diabetes. But just one of these injections costs about one-third of his meagre monthly salary.
            
            As with millions of Pakistanis with health conditions, the only thing that keeps food on his table and a roof over his head is unreliable charitable assistance to help pay for an unaffordable medicine that he cannot live without. His story is just one of so many examples of Pakistan’s severe healthcare crisis and one of so many reasons why the government needs to change course to ensure every Pakistani’s human right to the highest attainable standard of health.
            
            According to the Pakistani nongovernmental healthcare organization, Sehat Kahani, more than 50 per cent of Pakistanis do not have access to basic primary healthcare services, and approximately 42 per cent have no access to health coverage. But recent government policy changes will most likely make this worse. In February, the cabinet increased the prices of 146 essential medicines, placing many of them even further out of the reach of people with lower incomes.</p>

        <h3>Schools to close as air pollution hits record high in Pakistan’s Lahore</h3>
        <p>At first, you cannot see it but you can smell it. It smells like something is burning. And it intensifies as the temperature drops.

            Then the smoke and fog start to envelop you and the city around you. Now you can see it. You are walking through the smoke, a thick ceiling of it hanging overhead.
            
            If you are not wearing a mask or you lower it for a moment, you will immediately inhale the bitter air.

<h1>Global health security</h1>
<p>Pakistan’s National Public Health Institute (NPHI) strengthens the country’s capabilities to detect and respond to health threats. NPHI partners with other institutes to focus on research, environmental and occupational health, nutrition, non-communicable diseases, and vaccines.

    CDC helped Pakistan complete the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) in 2023. The JEE evaluates public health capacities to help countries understand gaps in their national health security and focus on closing them.</p>

    DC strengthens influenza surveillance in Pakistan through a cooperative agreement with the Pakistan National Institute of Health (NIH). Since 2004, five surveillance sites were established to conduct surveillance for influenza-like illness in outpatient settings. These sites also conduct surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness among hospitalized patients.

    Pakistan is the only country where extensively drug resistant typhoid fever is regularly occurring. CDC works with local government, Field Epidemiology Training Program, and health security partners to expand surveillance for typhoid and waterborne diseases. CDC also enhances typhoid prevention and response efforts, and engages in several projects related to bacterial diseases.
    
    Laboratory strengthening
    The Global Laboratory Leadership Program (GLLP) began its first phase in Pakistan in 2019. GLLP strengthens the country's laboratory leadership and management capabilities, which are key functions in public health preparedness and response. The first cohort of GLLP in Pakistan graduated in 2023.
    
    Four of Pakistan’s five disease surveillance sites established on-site laboratory capabilities for influenza testing to enhance rapid detection of influenza outbreaks.
    
    Workforce development
    CDC has supported Pakistan's Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) since 2006. The Pakistan FELTP includes two tiers:
    
    FELTP-Advanced prepares epidemiologists for national-level public health leadership.
    FELTP-Frontline trains health workers as community-level epidemiologists.
    FELTP has been a key technical asset during several health emergencies and was instrumental in establishing Pakistan’s first hepatitis surveillance sites. Ownership of the FELTP was officially transferred to the Government of Pakistan.
