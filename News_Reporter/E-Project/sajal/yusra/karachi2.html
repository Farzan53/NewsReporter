        <p>A lengthy personal essay published last year in the book Pakistan: Here and Now, ranging over Pakistani politics, culture and society, argues that the problems of radicalisation in a country like Pakistan are intimately connected with the confusion at the heart of notions of the nature of the state. Does lack of clarity create the space for extremist thought to assert itself, perhaps because it promises a cultural certainty that is dearly missing from the state? Eos presents some excerpts from the essay…


            A CULTURE IN FLUX
            In 1985, a Muslim sectarian organisation sprang up around the town of Jhang in central Punjab, which would go on to define not only sectarian politics in Pakistan but also influence regional extremism throughout the region, such as in Afghanistan and the disputed region of Kashmir.

        <h3>Punjabi culture is one of the world's oldest and most vibrant cultures. It includes music, dance, food, festivals, art, and craft, as well as the Punjabi language. 
        </h3>
        <p>LAHORE: Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in an event at Alhamra on Saturday, dealt with the subject of Punjab language and culture, regretting at the apathetic attitude of the Punjabis towards their language and culture.

            “Punjabi is such a sweet language. I feel sorry that people across the world take pride in speaking their language and are fond of it. Sindhis speak their language and take pride in it. People in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa speak Pashto and are proud of it. The Baloch speak their language and take pride in it. But when Punjabis speak their language, they don’t take pride in it, rather they teach their children either Urdu or English. I include myself in it but this is not good.”
            
            She urged the parents to take pride in their Punjabi identity and teach their children Punjabi language besides teaching them English to compete in the world as well as Urdu, the national language.
            
            The CM was addressing the Punjab Culture Day event at the Alhamra Art Centre on the Mall Road on Saturday.</p>

<h1>2025 Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation – Call for Concept Notes for Pakistany</h1>
<p>The AFCP will not award grants to individuals, commercial entities, or past award recipients that have not fulfilled the objectives or reporting requirements of previous awards.  All organizations must have a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) number issued via www.SAM.gov as well as a valid registration on SAM.gov. to receive U.S. federal assistance. If a concept note advances to round two (submission of complete proposals) and if the anticipated implementer is not registered in SAM.gov, they should initiate the registration process immediately so that it is in place in the event the project is ultimately selected for an award. The registration process can take several weeks to complete so it is important to avoid any delay. If a project is selected for an award and the registration is not completed, the award could be delayed to the next Fiscal Year, pending the availability of funding.  </p>
