        <h3>PIA flight lands on wrong runway amid heavy fog
        </h3>
        <p>LAHORE:
            A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight narrowly avoided disaster when the pilot allegedly landed on the wrong runway at Lahore Airport in adverse weather conditions.
            
            Flight PK-150, originally scheduled from Dammam to Multan, was diverted to Lahore due to heavy fog and poor visibility in Multan.
            
            Upon arrival in Lahore, the aircraft was reportedly landed on runway 36L instead of the designated main runway.
            
            According to sources, the runway lights were switched off at the time of the landing, exacerbating the potential risk.
            
            The PIA administration has taken swift action, grounding both the captain and the first officer.

<h1>How Lahore’s Smog Crisis Endangers Women’s Health and Fertility</h1>
<p>Lahore’s smog is a toxic blend of fine particles like PM2.5 and PM10, harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide, along with black carbon, volatile organic compounds, and construction dust. 

    These pollutants come from vehicles, which have increased by 9 percent in the last five years, industrial emissions, coal-burning brick kilns, and open agricultural burning in Pakistan and across the border in India.

    DC strengthens influenza surveillance in Pakistan through a cooperative agreement with the Pakistan National Institute of Health (NIH). Since 2004, five surveillance sites were established to conduct surveillance for influenza-like illness in outpatient settings. These sites also conduct surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness among hospitalized patients.

    Pakistan is the only country where extensively drug resistant typhoid fever is regularly occurring. CDC works with local government, Field Epidemiology Training Program, and health security partners to expand surveillance for typhoid and waterborne diseases. CDC also enhances typhoid prevention and response efforts, and engages in several projects related to bacterial diseases.
    
    Laboratory strengthening
    The Global Laboratory Leadership Program (GLLP) began its first phase in Pakistan in 2019. GLLP strengthens the country's laboratory leadership and management capabilities, which are key functions in public health preparedness and response. The first cohort of GLLP in Pakistan graduated in 2023.
    
    Four of Pakistan’s five disease surveillance sites established on-site laboratory capabilities for influenza testing to enhance rapid detection of influenza outbreaks.
    
    Workforce development
    CDC has supported Pakistan's Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) since 2006. The Pakistan FELTP includes two tiers:
    
    FELTP-Advanced prepares epidemiologists for national-level public health leadership.
    FELTP-Frontline trains health workers as community-level epidemiologists.
    FELTP has been a key technical asset during several health emergencies and was instrumental in establishing Pakistan’s first hepatitis surveillance sites. Ownership of the FELTP was officially transferred to the Government of Pakistan.
