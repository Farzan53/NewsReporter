            On her inaugural visit to Lahore, United States Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) Natalie Baker, joined by Consul General Kristin Hawkins, explored how US-Pakistan partnerships have been strengthening bilateral trade and investment, cultural preservation efforts and educational opportunities for youth in Punjab.

        <h3>The fifth season: How smog is gagging life, livelihood, and culture in Lahore
        </h3>
        <p>LAHORE:
            Every day, as Lahoris wake up, their hands sleepily gravitate towards their phones. They do this not to check WhatsApp messages, but to check the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the city. This daily act, filled with anxiety, marks the arrival of "Smog Season 2024", the worst yet. Days with 1,000+ AQI levels have not only increased in frequency but are becoming the new normal. How does one react to such a reading? How does one prepare when the light streaming in is tinted brown and grey?

There's little control over the air, but when the most basic requirement of life is filled with toxins, one feels helpless. People in Lahore — and, as of this writing, in Multan — must decide how to live amidst some of the worst air pollution on record. Life goes on, but residents face an impossible choice about how much they must choke to keep living.
