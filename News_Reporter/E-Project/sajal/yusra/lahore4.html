        <h3>Govt creating problems for itself by making unilateral decisions: Bilawa
        </h3>
        <p>In a speech at an event in the federal capital, Bila­w­al Bhutto underscored the importance of consensus-based policymaking, emphasising that Pakistan's political system thrives when the government listens to the people and collaborates with key stakeholders.

            "Whenever the government makes decisions without consulting its allies or considering the public's wishes, it ends up complicating the situation for itself," he remarked.
            
            The PPP leader also recalled the party’s long-standing support for workers' rights and the struggle of Pakistan's working class.
            
            He noted that the efforts of three generations of PPP leaders have led to the establishment of significant rights for the nation's workers, starting with the historic contributions of his grandfather, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who helped secure the Constitution, and continuing with the leadership of his late mother, Benazir Bhutto, who stood firm against military dictatorship.
