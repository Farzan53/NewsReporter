        <h3>State is foundation of politics: COAS
            
        </h3>
        <p>PESHAWAR:
            During his interaction with politicians in Peshawar, COAS Gen Syed Asim Munir has clarified that Afghanistan is a brotherly neighboring Islamic country, and Pakistan has always sought better relations with it.
            
            "Our only disagreement with Afghanistan lies in the presence of the Khawarij miscreants on Afghan soil and their cross-border terrorism in Pakistan. This will persist until they resolve this issue," he said.
            
            He said there is no large-scale operation being conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, nor is there any control of Khawarij miscreants in any part of Pakistan.

        <h3>Pakistan's Peshawar HC suspends deportation of 100 Afghan musicians

        </h3>
        <p>A high court in Peshawar has stopped the forcible deportation of over 100 Afghan musicians seeking political asylum in Pakistan and directed the federal government to decide their cases in two months.

            A two-member bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) disposed of the case after hearing arguments on Friday and instructed security agencies not to take any action against them during the two months.
            
            The bench headed by Justice Waqar Ahmad gave the judgement during the hearing of the petition filed by Hashmatullah who argued they belonged to Afghanistan but migrated to Pakistan after the establishment of the Taliban government as their lives were under threat.

<h1>Bringing back the past</h1>

<p>
    he restoration of the houses of Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor in Peshawar is back in the news, as the funds sanctioned for the project have reportedly been released.
    
    Although there have long been gestures and good intentions regarding the cultural heritage of Peshawar – home to some of the most celebrated performers with immense following – it was during the 1990s, under the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, that significant attention was drawn to this legacy. At that time, the government decided to confer a civilian award on Dilip Kumar, which brought renewed focus to Peshawar’s cultural ancestry.
    
    This initiative also re-ignited discussions about the properties associated with these iconic film stars and the need for their restoration. However, it was not until the tenure of the Awami National Party government in the 2010s that concrete steps were taken to restore the homes of these legendary figures, marking them as symbols of pride for the city.
