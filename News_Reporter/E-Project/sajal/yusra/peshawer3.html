        <h3>State is foundation of politics: COAS
            
        </h3>
        <p>PESHAWAR:
            During his interaction with politicians in Peshawar, COAS Gen Syed Asim Munir has clarified that Afghanistan is a brotherly neighboring Islamic country, and Pakistan has always sought better relations with it.
            
            "Our only disagreement with Afghanistan lies in the presence of the Khawarij miscreants on Afghan soil and their cross-border terrorism in Pakistan. This will persist until they resolve this issue," he said.
            
            He said there is no large-scale operation being conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, nor is there any control of Khawarij miscreants in any part of Pakistan.

        <h3>Peshawar High Court Restrains KP Government from Using Discretionary Funds

        </h3>
        <p>in a hearing regarding the Chief Minister's discretionary funds, the Peshawar High Court issued a written order from the previous session prohibiting the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government from using these funds.

            The court highlighted that discretionary funds had been included in the Annual Development Plan (ADP), and noted that the Supreme Court had previously rejected using block allocation funds.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Following the federal government's decision to outlaw the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi is set to land in Peshawar where he will attend a high-level meeting today to address the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government's reservations over the ban.

            KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur said this on Wednesday as he chaired a joint meeting of the members of the treasury and opposition benches.

<h1>Peshawar school massacre</h1>

<p>
    At the time of the incident, the Army Public School held more than 1,000 staff members and students; many of the pupils were children of military personnel. The terrorists began their attack in mid-morning when they accessed the large compound by scaling a wall. According to some reports, they bombed their own vehicle to create a distraction for school guards. Entering the main assembly hall, where a large group of students was taking a lesson in first aid, they proceeded to shoot indiscriminately. The attackers, who were armed with grenades and automatic rifles, then went to the classrooms, where they concentrated their fire on teachers and older children. According to official sources, they sought only to kill and made no attempt to take hostages.
