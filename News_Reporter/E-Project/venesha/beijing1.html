        <h3>Beijing air pollution study could unlock solution to persistent smog</h3>
        <p>Photographs of smog enveloping Beijing’s Bird’s Nest stadium became one of the defining images of 
the first decade of this century. China’s annual air pollution deaths reached 2.6 million people a
year in 2005. At the time, Beijing was crowned smog capital of the world and concerns for the 
health of athletes overshadowed preparations for the 2008 Olympic Games. But rapid improvements
followed, with clean-up technologies fitted to coal-burning power stations and industrial plants,
followed by their conversion to fossil gas. New vehicles were fitted with tighter emissions 
controls and fuels were improved. However, while figures from the city government show that 
particle pollution in Beijing reduced by more than 60% over the 10 years from 2013 to the end of 
2022, it is still six times greater than the World Health Organization guidelines. But a new 
study gives more insight to the origins of some of that pollution. In 2018, Dr Kaspar Rudolf 
Dällenbach and an international team set up one of the world’s most sophisticated air pollution
measurement sites on the roof of the Beijing University of Chemical Technology. Dällenbach, 
from Switzerland’s Paul Scherrer Institut, said: “Despite continuous air quality improvements
over the last decade, Beijing is still affected by air pollution episodes. I wanted to know 
why.” The scale and complexity of the challenge to reduce Beijing’s air pollution was further 
revealed during Covid lockdowns. Dällenbach explained: “With substantial decreases in traffic,

Among the featured presenters was Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) associate professor Xi Chen
who discussed the relationship between early life circumstances and long-term human development,
emphasizing the importance of early interventions for lifelong health. Professors Xiaoyan Lei 
from Peking University, Sean Sylvia from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and
Xingwu Ran from Sichuan University led discussions on health economics, sustainable development, public
 policy, and community health initiatives. These lectures provided participants with a comprehensive
  understanding of health from individual, social, human, animal, environmental, and planetary perspectives.

        <h3>Beijing Declaration Urges Global Unity on Traditional Medicine</h3>
        <p>At the 2024 World Conference on Traditional Medicine held in Beijing on 3–4 December, participants 
            from 85 countries adopted the Beijing Declaration. This declaration emphasizes the important role 
of traditional medicine as a carrier of cultural heritage across the globe and highlights its
significant contribution to health throughout the life course. It also calls for strengthened 
research, evidence, and international collaboration to effectively integrate traditional medicine
into global healthcare systems.
Attended by over 3000 participants, the conference was co-sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO),
 and hosted by the National Health Commission of China, the National Administration of Traditional Chinese 
 Medicine, and the Beijing Municipal Government.
China's President Xi Jinping, in a letter read by Yin Li, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the
 Communist Party of China during the opening of the conference, highlighted that China attaches equal 
 importance to the development of both modern and traditional Chinese medicine, promoting their complementary
 strengths, fostering the modernization and industrialization of traditional medicine, and developing a unique 
 pathway for its growth and integration into healthcare systems. He affirmed that China is willing to work
  with the international community to promote the integration of evidence-based traditional medicine into the 
  global health system.
Speaking during a media interview, WHO Assistant Director-General Dr Bruce Aylward underscored China's efforts 
in modernizing traditional medicine and integrating modern technology into its evaluation and use. He remarked 
that China has been "in a leading position in modernizing traditional" and highlighted its achievements in 
"the inheritance and innovation of traditional medicine."

    As China Gets Another Covid-Like Scare, Beijing Calls It 'Winter Occurrence'</h1>
<p>As photos and videos emerge on social media showing hospitals in China swamped with people amid rising 
    cases of human metapneumovirus or HMPV - a respiratory illness with symptoms similar to those of a flu -
    there are serious concerns of another health crisis after COVID-19.
    Beijing however, has downplayed the developments in recent days, passing it off as an annual occurrence in
     winter.   
    As international reports cautioned travelers to reconsider their travel plans to China for the time being,
     Beijing issued a press statement to address such concerns. China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning 
     said on Friday that "Respiratory infections tend to peak during the winter season".   
    Reassuring citizens and tourists, she said "I can assure you that the Chinese government cares about the 
    health of Chinese citizens and foreigners coming to China", adding that "It is safe to travel in China".  
    When asked about the overcrowded hospitals and reports of the surge in respiratory illnesses, she said 
    "The diseases appears to be less severe and spread with a smaller scale compared to the previous year". 
    She also urged citizens and tourists to refer to the guidelines issued by the National Disease Control and 
    Prevention Administration of China.
