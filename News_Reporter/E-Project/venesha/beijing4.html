        <h3>Beijing Calls Washington’s Bluff on Strategic Metals</h3>
        <p> Earlier this December, the Chinese government announced that it would curb the export of several 
 key industrial minerals, as well as certain types of graphite. The move came in the context of
    mounting pressure on China from Washington, and in anticipation of stringent tariffs that Donald 
J. Trump has promised to levy when he returns to the presidency next year. Chinese government
 spokespeople have argued that curbing export of these minerals is in line with their government’s
 antiproliferation efforts. They have said that the materials are “dual use,” and that they 
 might be used in manufacturing weapons. Officials in the United States have historically also 
argued the same thing about some of the minerals, such as graphite, which the US put under
strict export controls in 2006. Among the minerals are antimony (which is used in night-vision
 goggles and bullets), gallium (precision-guided weapons and radar systems), and germanium 
(powerful sensors that are mounted on tanks, ships and helicopters). Superhard metals like 
tungsten may also be included in the restrictions, as is graphite, a type of carbon familiar
 from its use in pencils. Certain types of graphite are used in gun barrels, and others are 
 dispersed on the battlefield as a sort of smoke that confuses electromagnetic wave detection
  devices. Most of these materials also have considerable civilian uses. For instance, 
  graphite is used in the anodes, or negative electrodes, of almost all lithium-ion batteries. 
  (If you’re reading this article on a battery-powered device, you’re probably using graphite in some form.) 
  What export controls mean is that non-Chinese companies that use the material in products destined for the
   United States will have to apply for export licenses. Such licenses will be up to Chinese officials to 
   grant or withhold. China controls the vast majority of the processing of some of these materials—a fact 
   that began to register widely in Washington only as tensions began to ramp up with China during the 
   previous Trump administration. China, for instance, produces 61 percent of natural graphite and 98 percent
    of the world’s final processed graphite.

        <h3>Chancellor marks £600m of secure growth for UK economy in Beijing</h3>
        <p> Lifting of market access barriers across areas such as agri-food, helping British business compete
on level-playing field and grow exports.
Pragmatic cooperation results in agreements worth £600 million to the UK economy over the next five
years and sets course to deliver up to £1 billion.
The UK continues to challenge China on areas of disagreement, with the Chancellor raising concerns 
over China’s support for Russia’s illegal war, domestic interference and sanctions against British
parliamentarians.
Working people and businesses across the UK will feel the benefits of agreements worth £600 million
to the British economy, as agreed in the 2025 UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD).
Such as financial services, trade, investment, and the climate to support secure growth, while being
frank and open on areas of disagreement.                     
Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:
The agreements we’ve reached show that pragmatic cooperation between the world’s largest economies 
can help us boost economic growth for the benefit of working people – a priority of our Plan for Change.
More widely, today is a platform for respectful and consistent future relations with China. One where we can
 be frank and open on areas where we disagree, protecting our values and security interests, and finding 
 opportunities for safe trade and investment.
Britain is a leading financial services partner for China. A range of financial services companies with a 
substantial presence in the market - HSBC, Standard Chartered, Prudential, Schroders, abdrn, Fidelity 
International and London Stock Exchange Group – accompanied the Chancellor as a business delegation on the 
trip. The granting of new licences and quota allocations for UK firms such as HSBC, Schroders, abrdn and          
Both sides have committed to improving existing channels to discuss more sensitive issues, including the need 
to speak candidly about national and economic security. In her engagement, the Chancellor made clear UK 
concerns about imbalances in the Chinese economy, and both sides agreed to discuss industrial policy in 
support of a global level playing field.        
The UK and China have agreed to further cooperation including through strengthening the existing 
UK-China clean energy partnership and committing to a dialogue on international development – to work together
 in tackling shared global challenges.
The lifting of barriers that restricted export to China across a range of goods and services will 
support UK exports and innovation, particularly in the agri-food sector where a package headlined by pork,
 wool, poultry, and pet food stands to boost UK trade with China and support new jobs. China has also agreed 
 to continue to liberalise sectors that restrict foreign investment, such as education and culture, and support a level playing field and fair competition.

        <h3> China orders pay cap at state-owned financial firms, sources say </h3>         
        <p> China is set to impose a 1 million yuan ($137,309) cap on the annual income of staff at central
government-owned financial institutions, three sources said, expanding a campaign against excess
against a backdrop of economic slowdown.
Those whose income already exceeds 1 million yuan will have their payout cut, such as middle and
senior managers whose income will as much as halve in an overhaul of the compensation structure 
at 27 financial giants including the "Big Five" banks, six leading insurers and four major bad 
debt managers.
The bulk of cuts will be made by shrinking bonuses, said two of the three people, who have direct knowledge of
 the plan but declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The most sweeping wage reduction exercise in the $67 trillion finance sector will begin as early as next month 
though staff are yet to be informed of reasons, the people said.
The cap is in line with the government's "common prosperity" drive launched in 2021 to address social and 
income inequality as growth slowed in the world's second-largest economy.
Both state-owned and private financial firms have since proactively lowered salaries and bonuses and 
discouraged the show of wealth such as by asking staff to avoid wearing expensive clothes and watches.
Income caps at state-owned financial institutions, however, could make it harder to retain top talent when
 private-sector rivals offer competitive compensation packages.
The pay cap at central government-owned financial firms was first reported by news outlet Caixin citing
 unidentified regulatory and banking sources.
 Executive income at subsidiaries of the targeted firms, including investment banks and asset managers, will
  be capped at 3 million yuan, the three people also said.
Some senior executives at subsidiaries currently earn as much as 5 million yuan, stock exchange filings showed.
The Ministry of Finance - the targeted firms' biggest shareholder - and the Ministry of Human Resources and
 Social Security did not reply to Reuters' requests for comment.

<h1>Sharif’s Beijing trip: Can China-Pakistan Economic Corridor be revived?</h1>
<p>Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is scheduled to fly to China on June 4 for a five-day trip that
     will see him engage with Beijing’s top leadership, at a time when Islamabad has come to increasingly rely
      on its alliance with the world’s second-largest economy.
    Sharif will visit Beijing, Xi’an and Shenzhen — the southern city that China showcases as a poster child 
    of its dramatic economic rise since the 1980s. Shenzhen was handpicked by then-leader Deng Xiaoping as the
     country’s first special economic zone.
     As Pakistan looks to similarly kick-start its economy from the doldrums, amid high inflation and a debt
      crisis, one multibillion-dollar economic project is at the heart of its ambitions:
The $62bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), formally launched in 2015 by the two Asian nations, was
 pitted by the governments and many analysts in both countries as a “game-changer” for Pakistan’s economy. It 
 included the construction of a flagship seaport, power plants and road networks across the South Asian country.
 Yet nearly a decade later, questions hover over the future of the project.
The CPEC is a key component of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive network of roads, 
bridges and ports spread across nearly 100 countries that Beijing hopes will recreate the ancient Silk Road
 trade routes linking Europe and Asia.
But critics say the BRI is a vehicle for China to expand its geopolitical influence and puts poorer countries
 such as Pakistan under more debt.
In Pakistan, the project included the building of a seaport at Gwadar in the south, along with the development
 of the country’s energy, transport and industrial sectors. While there were initial successes, the CPEC had a
  bumpy ride in Pakistan due to the country’s frequent political, economic and security crises and has
  effectively come to a halt.
  Now, a recently-elected government in cash-strapped Pakistan is making a renewed push to ramp up the CPEC.
