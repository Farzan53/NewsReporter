        <h3>China’s Xi holds talks with Vietnam’s new leader in Beijing</h3>
        <p>China’s President Xi Jinping has held talks with Vietnam’s President To Lam in Beijing on his first
 state visit since becoming his country’s top leader, according to Chinese official media Xinhua. 
 The meeting between Xi and Lam on Monday signals the close ties between the two communist-run
  neighbours, which have well-developed economic and trade relations despite occasional strains
  over their competing claims in the South China Sea. The visit comes just a month after Lam took 
  over in Hanoi following the death of Vietnam’s longtime Communist Party leader Nguyen Phu 
  Trong. China, displaying exuberance over Lam choosing China for his first official trip, said 
  last week it “fully reflects the great importance he attaches to the development of ties 
 between both parties and countries”. “China has always regarded Vietnam as a priority in its 
      neighbourhood diplomacy, and supports Vietnam in adhering to the Party leadership, taking the socialist
       path suited to its national conditions, and deepening the cause of reforms and socialist 
     modernisation,” Xi said at the meeting. “I believe that our road will expand wider as we walk
 further,” said Xi, who underscored establishing good working relations and personal friendship with 
   Lam. Lam described the bilateral ties as a “top priority in Vietnam’s external policy” and called his
trip to China “the affirmation of the Party and the Vietnamese government to value the relation with
 China”. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, greeted Lam and his wife, Ngo Phuong Ly, when they arrived at
  the airport in Beijing. Photos posted by Chinese and Vietnamese online publications later showed          
  the couple being welcomed by Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan. Lam arrived in China’s southern Guangzhou 
  province on Sunday for a three-day visit that will also include meetings with Premier Li Qiang and other top 
  Chinese officials.</p>

        <h3>Top Biden adviser in Beijing as China faces off against US allies</h3>
        <p>Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the 
airspace breach – the first by a military aircraft – was “not only a serious violation of Japan’s
sovereignty but it also threatens our security”.
Meanwhile, the Philippine defence chief on Tuesday accused China of being the “biggest disruptor” 
of peace in Southeast Asia following a week of confrontations between the two countries’ ships 
near a flashpoint disputed shoal in the South China Sea.
Sullivan’s plane landed at Beijing’s Capital airport just before 2pm (06:00 GMT). He was welcomed 
on the tarmac by US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns and Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
official Yang Tao. 
Sullivan met Wang at a resort on the northern outskirts of the Chinese capital, where they shook hands in 
front of Chinese and US flags.
In his remarks in front of journalists, Wang described China-US ties as “critical” and which have taken
 “twists and turns”.
“I hope, as always, the communication will be not only strategic but also substantive and, at the same time,
 very constructive,” he said.
 “We are committed to making the investments, strengthening our alliances, and taking the common steps on tech
  and national security that we need to take,” the official said, referring to sweeping restrictions on US
   technology transfers to China imposed under President Joe Biden.
“We are committed to managing this competition responsibly … and preventing it from veering into conflict,”
she added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

        <h3> Beijing Sees Bruising Times Ahead With Trump Return </h3>         
        <p>Donald Trump’s victory, at the very least, does provide it with a bit more clarity over what the
             next few years might hold. His threat of 60% tariffs is looming over Beijing just as President Xi
              Jinping is busy trying to stabilize the economy.
His latest bid to do that — a 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) debt-swap program announced today —
disappointed investors looking for more forceful fiscal policies to stem a crisis of confidence
and property crunch.
Still, some analysts are hoping that Trump’s win means China follows that up with more stimulus. 
They think the president-elect’s aggressive protectionist stance on trade could force Beijing’s
hand to spend more on its economy to boost domestic consumption, which it’s been reluctant to do 
so far.
After being somewhat caught on the back foot when Trump kicked off his first trade war in March 2018, Chinese
 policymakers now have an expanded toolkit to hit back at tariffs.
 But they’re also unlikely to unleash a hefty chunk of stimulus before Trump details his policy approach. 
 Despite his affinity for trade levies, Trump — the self-proclaimed “Tariff Man” — might not have China at the
  top of his agenda. Wars in the Middle East and Ukraine are pressing concerns.
Meanwhile, the process of doling out levies could also be relatively drawn out, with hikes potentially imposed 
in stages in what JPMorgan calls an “escalate to de-escalate” playbook.
A deal could take a while to negotiate: The phase-one agreement during Trump’s first presidency was a product
 of nearly two years of acrimonious talks. And there’s always the possibility of some sort of crisis over 
 Taiwan derailing any negotiations.
Officials in Beijing are looking at a bruising, unpredictable four years. They may want to keep some powder
 dry until they know just how painful it could all get.

<h1>Hamas and Fatah sign unity deal in Beijing aimed at Gaza governance</h1>
<p> Palestinian factions have signed a “national unity” agreement aimed at maintaining Palestinian control
     over Gaza once Israel’s war on the enclave concludes.
    The deal, finalised on Tuesday in China after three days of intensive talks, lays the groundwork for an 
    “interim national reconciliation government” to rule post-war Gaza, said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
     The agreement was signed by long-term rivals Hamas and Fatah, as well as 12 other Palestinian groups.
     “Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is 
     national unity,” said senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk at a news conference in Beijing. 
     Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, one of the 14 factions to 
     sign the accord, told Al Jazeera the agreement goes “much further” than any other reached in recent years.
He said its four main elements are the establishment of an interim national unity government, the formation of
 unified Palestinian leadership ahead of future elections, the free election of a new Palestinian National
  Council, and a general declaration of unity in the face of ongoing Israeli attacks.
  The move towards a unity government is especially important, he said, because it “blocks Israeli efforts to 
  create some sort of collaborative structure against Palestinian interests”.
  Reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah would be a key turning point in internal Palestinian relations. The
   two main Palestinian political parties in the Palestinian territory have been bitter rivals since conflict
    arose in 2006, after which Hamas seized control of Gaza.
