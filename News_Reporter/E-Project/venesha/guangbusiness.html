        <h3>Guangzhou forum focuses on low-altitude economy as new growth engine</h3>
<p>On the sidelines of the event, a forum on "Low-Altitude Economy - A New Engine for China's Economic Growth"
     was co-hosted by the China Institute for Innovation and Development Strategy and Nanjing University of
      Aeronautics and Astronautics.
The forum garnered significant attention from a diverse array of participants, including industry leaders, 
renowned scholars, international experts in the field of low-altitude economy, as well as key executives from 
leading enterprises in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Yangtze River Delta region.        
Discussions at the forum are focused on the role of the low-altitude economy in driving Chinese 
economic growth and global economic transformation and upgrading.           
Attendees collectively acknowledged that the low altitude economy, as a strategic emerging industry, is a 
representative of new quality productive forces, poised to become a new engine for global economic 
transformation and upgrading.           
They noted that the low-altitude economy has the potential to not only drive optimization of industrial 
structure and coordinated development of regional economy, but also promote economic recovery, cooperation and
 innovation worldwide.          
They underlined the need for enhanced open collaboration, improved policy guidance and technological 
innovation mechanisms, and the establishment of new models for global industrial cooperation to foster the
 healthy development of the low-altitude economy.          
Participants highlighted the necessity for further refinement in the development model of the low-altitude
economy, increased exploration of market demands by low-altitude operating companies, breakthroughs in core
 technologies in key fields such as airspace planning, flight control, and safety supervision, and strengthened
  support for low-altitude service management through infrastructure development.          
The attendees noted significant achievements in recent years in areas such as the reform of low-altitude 
airspace management and the establishment of unmanned aerial test zones. They said that the development of the
 low-altitude economy has transitioned from "pilot exploration" to "large-scale practice," representing a
  crucial initiative in the construction of a modern socialist country on all front.           
It was agreed at the forum that universities, government, enterprises and industry guidance authorities should
 work together closely to further overcome key technological bottlenecks, optimize business models and 
 regulatory systems, solidify infrastructure, and propel the high-quality development of the low-altitude
  economy in order to further unleash its potential as a new engine for China's economic growth.

<h1>Guangzhou highlights 4.4% YoY growth in bilateral trade with ROK</h1>
    
<p>The import and export volume between Guangzhou and the Republic of Korea reached 32.2 billion yuan from
     January to October this year, up 4.4% year on year, with imports amounting to 22.46 billion yuan, a 10.7%
      increase compared to the same period last year, according to the latest statistics released at the 2024
       Guangzhou-ROK Economic and Trade Cooperation Roundtable Dialogue on December 10.
    By October 2024, over 1,800 Korean enterprises had established operations in Guangzhou, with actual foreign
     investment reaching 3.825 billion USD.   
    The event attracted 50 senior representatives from ROK-invested enterprises in Guangzhou, including Hyundai
     Motor's first overseas fuel cell system facility, HTWO Guangzhou.   
    According to Wu Bingxiang, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Commerce, ROK is an 
    important trading partner of Guangzhou, and the city highly values cooperation with ROK. Wu welcomes 
    ROK-invested enterprises to share development opportunities with Guangzhou, increase technological 
    upgrades, expand production, and explore new business layouts. Guangzhou will continue to provide 
    comprehensive support and high-quality services to all ROK-invested enterprises. 
    Kang Sangwook, Consul General of the Republic of Korea in Guangzhou, expressed his appreciation for
     Guangzhou's support, which has contributed to the thriving development of ROK-invested enterprises in 
     various fields. He noted that the roundtable dialogue has been held for five consecutive years, laying a
      solid foundation for future cooperation.
    To better serve foreign-invested enterprises in Guangzhou, the city has continuously optimized the foreign
     investment environment and improved service efficiency in recent years. A "whitelist" service mechanism 
     for key foreign-invested enterprises has been established and jointly implemented by relevant government
      departments and district governments. This mechanism considers various factors such as foreign 
      investment, foreign trade, new productive forces, and economic contributions to determine "whitelist"
       enterprises and provide them with services such as easy access, resource sharing, and compliance support.
