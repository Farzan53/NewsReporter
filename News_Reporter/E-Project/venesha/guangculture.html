        <h3>Guangzhou and Aksu Spotlight Cultural Heritage at the 2024 Understanding China Conference</h3>
        <p>Guangzhou hosted the 2024 Understanding China Conference, organized by China Institute for 
            Innovation & Development Strategy, from December 2 to 4, a landmark event showcasing China's rich
             cultural tapestry. Aksu, a cultural gem from Xinjiang, traversed vast distances to collaborate 
with Guangzhou, underscoring China's commitment to cultural exchange and heritage preservation. 
This partnership highlighted the vital role of global youth in fostering a deeper understanding 
of China's vibrant history and modernization journey. As part of the conference, the seminar 
Reviving Qiuci: Preserving and Passing Down Cultural Heritage under Chinese Modernization 
gathered experts and scholars to discuss Qiuci's cultural legacy, highlighted by the debut of the
Qiuci Grottoes Digital Exhibition, which promoted global dialogue and collaboration. Another 
highlight was the launch of the Understanding China: New Youth Exploring Xinjiang – Aksu 2024 
Short Video Conference, empowering young creators to share unique perspectives on Aksu and
deepen cultural connections. Aksu, historically known as Qiuci, is located at the crossroads of
ancient civilizations along the Silk Road. Once a hub for political, cultural, and trade 
exchanges, Aksu continues to captivate with its music, dance, murals, and grotto art. "Aksu is
the cradle of Qiuci culture, which embodies the harmonious blending of diverse
civilizations," said Wu Hongzhan, Secretary of the Aksu Prefectural Party Committee. He 
emphasized that Qiuci culture exemplifies deep-rooted interactions among China's ethnic 
groups and its tradition of embracing global civilizations. Yu Zhiyong, Vice President of
Xinjiang's Cultural and Museum Bureau, noted, "Qiuci is both a witness to our unified,
multi-ethnic nation and a living symbol of the Silk Road's historical legacy. It offers a 
unique lens to understand China's history and cultural diversity." Former Ethiopian
President Mulatu Teshome also praised the initiative, stating, "Reviving Qiuci culture 
reflects China's commitment to global cultural dialogue and mutual respect. It's a
testament to the nation's vision for fostering shared progress through civilizational 
exchange." This year's conference showcased the transformative power of youth in bridging cultural divides. Through initiatives such as short video creation and immersive storytelling, young people are actively participating in global cultural exchanges, offering fresh perspectives on China's blend of tradition and modernity. By creating such opportunities, the conference reinforced China's vision of breaking cultural barriers, fostering East-West dialogue, and inspiring a new generation to contribute to the global cultural mosaic.

        <h3>Cartier unveils “Into the Wild” panther exhibition in Guangzhou  </h3>         
<p> French luxury goods brand Cartier has launched a panther-themed exhibition called  “Into the Wild”. Housed
     at the Guangzhou Post Expo in China, the immersive showcase by the jeweller comprises eight rooms that
      pay tribute to Cartier’s emblematic animal: the panther.  
      To kick off the exhibition, Cartier brand ambassador Zhang Zhen made a virtual appearance in the Panther
       Salon in the form of a hologram, where he gave a speech about his own perception of the timeless brand.
      From April 20 to May 21, the exhibition will provide visitors with a multi-sensory, immersive experience 
      to shine a light on the brand’s timeless style and modern interpretation of its panther spirit. An
       iconic image of the Cartier brand since 1914, the panther is synonymous with strength, fearlessness,
       independence, and a free spirit – qualities that have become Cartier’s continued source of inspiration
        over the years.
        Not only can visitors witness the complex creation process of jewellery in the exhibition’s master 
        workshop, but they can also explore a replica of Jeanne Toussaint’s studio and office in Paris, the
         woman known for inspiring and popularising Cartier’s iconic panther.
The panther-themed exhibition also has a perfume sensory space, fashion hall, movie screening hall showing a 
three-part series of “Panther Lady: Jeanne Toussaint”, and a library and tea room in which guests can read up 
on the brand’s legendary books and photo albums of the panther-inspired style.
All in all, Cartier’s exhibition pays homage to the colourful history of Cartier’s emblem. Through its series
 of interconnected rooms, Into The Wild brings the tradition of craft closer to the viewer.
