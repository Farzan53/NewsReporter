        <h3>Novel amino acid mutations suggest local monkeypox transmission in Guangzhou, China</h3>
        <p> The monkeypox (mpox) virus has caused worldwide transmission since its initial report in England 
in early May 2022. Available data from the World Health Organization (WHO) show that Europe and 
the Americas experienced a huge wave of mpox virus infection. Now the number of infected cases is
on the rise in Asia. Several sporadic infections have been reported in China. In this study, the
authors of this article obtained high-quality whole viral genomic sequences using a mpox 
virus-specific amplicon-based sequencing strategy. The analysis of the phylogenomic 
characteristics indicated that all eight mpox virus sequences from Guangzhou belonged to the 
clade IIb lineage B.1.3 cluster. However, the exact origins where the virus was imported could
not be located, based on all the available mpox virus sequences from the Global Initiative on 
Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database (https://gisaid.org/), except for their closest 
sequence similarity to that was reported from Japan. Novel amino acid mutations were found among
the eight cases, suggesting that a local transmission may have occurred in Guangzhou, China.</p>

        <h3>China’s Guangzhou city sees Dengue fever cases rise by 73% in space of a week</h3>
        <p> The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou has seen a 73 per cent spike in Dengue fever cases in the
             space of a week.
Last week it recorded 437 cases, of which 360 were local and the rest imported. It also saw the 
first severe cases, three in total, in several months. The previous week saw 252 cases, according
to the local centre for disease control and prevention.
The Guangdong provincial disease control authorities have been closely watching the rise in cases 
of the mosquito-borne disease over the past two months.
In August the province’s disease control centre called for a state of high alert in its monthly report on
 infectious diseases because of the global rise in cases this year.
Since then there has been a steady rise in cases across Guangdong, with more in a single week – 1,770 between
 September 30 and October 6 – than the whole month of August, which saw 1,220 cases.
No deaths have been reported in Guangdong this year though the disease can be fatal.

        <h3>Dengue danger: China’s Guangzhou on alert as infection surge sparks concerns  </h3>         
        <p> Health authorities in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou are sounding the alarm over a surge 
in domestic dengue fever cases, calling for residents to be alert and do their part in curbing the
spread of the mosquito-borne disease.
Dengue cases jumped 73 per cent last week, compared to 252 cases reported the week before, said 
the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention in an Oct 16 report. Of the 437 dengue 
cases recorded, 360 were local residents and the rest imported. 
Cases have been reported in all 11 districts of Guangzhou, which has a total population of more than 17
 million. While no dengue-related deaths have been reported so far in the city, the disease can be fatal and 
 lead to long-term health complications, as doctors and medical experts often note. 
In the wider Guangdong province, dengue numbers have been rising steadily over the past two months. Between
 Sep 30 and Oct 6, 1,770 cases were recorded - an increase of 500 compared to all of August, authorities said. 
The infection surge has sparked concern among Chinese netizens, some describing the city as the epicentre of 
the outbreak in Guangdong province.
“The numbers are growing in Guangzhou. It’s very concerning,” commented one user on the popular microblogging 
platform Weibo in response to a local news article.
“No deaths (yet) but dengue fever is no joke. The high fever can kill you and the pain you feel in your bones 
can be unbearable,” the person cautioned.

<h1>Guangzhou building biopharma hub</h1>

<p> Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, is sparing no effort to build a global hub for innovation and 
    development of its biopharmaceutical industry, a city official said.
    This is expected to inject strong momentum into the sector in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay 
    Area and across the country.   
    The development of the biopharmaceutical industry will bring more hope and benefit a vast number of 
    patients, said Meng Hao, deputy secretary general of the Guangzhou municipal government.  
    To this end, the city government will establish a 150 billion yuan ($21.5 billion) industrial investment
     fund to promote cooperation between major financial investment companies and local investment
      institutions, with a focus on investing in the biomedicine sector, Meng said.   
    Meng made the remarks at a news conference on promoting Guangzhou's biopharmaceutical industry on Monday.
    Guangzhou has a population of nearly 24 million. It is the most populous city in the GBA, which includes
     nine Guangdong cities as well as Hong Kong and Macao.
The southern metropolis has about 6,800 registered medical and health institutions, including 47 major 
hospitals and eight national and regional medical centers.
"In the first half of this year, more than 93 million patient visits had been recorded in the city's medical
institutions, and the abundant medical resources provide broad space for the transformation of achievements
 and market application of biopharmaceutical enterprises," she said.
Guangzhou's biopharmaceutical industry is in the top tier in the country, and the city has more than 6,500 
biopharmaceutical and related enterprises, including 12 Fortune Global 500 companies, 23 listed companies and
 over 1,000 high-tech enterprises. These have formed biopharmaceutical industrial clusters that are playing an
  increasingly important role in the development of Guangzhou's pillar industry, said Meng.
The city will accord priority to the development of four major industries — biopharmaceutical, medicine, 
traditional Chinese medicine and high-end medical apparatus and instruments. It will also try to construct a
number of key State laboratories, industrial innovation centers, manufacturing innovation centers and national
 engineering technology centers in the next five years, said Meng.
