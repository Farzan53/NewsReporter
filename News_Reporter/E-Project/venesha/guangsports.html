        <h3>Former Asian champions Guangzhou denied permission to play</h3>
        <p> Guangzhou, once the dominant force in the country and the standard bearers of a decade of heavy 
spending in Chinese football, are one of three teams, including CSL outfit Cangzhou Mighty Lions and third-tier
 Hunan Xiangtao, ruled ineligible. "The club has made a lot of efforts to gain admission to the professional 
 league in the new season, however, due to the heavy historical debt, the funds raised are not enough," 
 Guangzhou said in a statement. "We regret that we failed to make it, hence our sincerest apologies to fans 
 and the people from all walks of life that support the club. "At the same time, thank you for your
  understanding and tolerance. We will not change our original intention and do our best to deal with the 
  aftermath and support the development of Chinese football and Guangdong and Guangzhou football." The 
  decision to exclude Guangzhou brings a final curtain down on an era of lavish spending within Chinese 
  football. Property developers China Evergrande purchased the club after relegation to China's second tier in 
  2010 and invested heavily, paying inflated transfer fees and high wages to attract the country's leading 
  players and high-profile overseas talent. That move sparked a major boom in the CSL as private business 
  sought to deliver President Xi Jinping's dream to turn the nation into a regional power with the goal of
   qualifying for, hosting and, eventually, winning the World Cup. As a sign of the club's ambition, Guangzhou 
   hired World Cup winning coach Marcello Lippi in 2012 and the Italian led his team to the 2013 Asian 
   Champions League title. Two years later another World Cup winner, Brazil's Luiz Felipe Scolari, repeated 
   the feat while continuing Guangzhou's domestic dominance as the club went on to win eight CSL titles in 
   nine seasons from 2011 to 2019. China Evergrande's financial issues, however, saw funding withdrawn from 
   the club in 2021 and, after key players and coaching staff departed, Guangzhou were relegated to China 
   League One at the end of the following campaign. Guangzhou finished 12th in the first season back in China
   League One in 2023 before finishing third in the 2024 season, missing out on promotion behind Yunnan Yukun 
   and Dalian Yingbo.</p>

        <h3>Ex-champions Guangzhou expelled from Chinese leagues </h3>         
        <p>China's most successful side Guangzhou FC will not play professionally next season because of their
failure to pay off enough of their substantial debt.
The eight-time Chinese Super League (CSL) champions have been refused permission by the Chinese 
Football Association to play in professional domestic football when the new campaign begins.          
It is a spectacular fall from grace and brings to an end an era of lavish spending that propelled 
them to two AFC Champions League titles in three years in 2013 and 2015.           
During that successful period they finished fourth at the Club World Cup, agreed an academy 
partnership with Real Madrid and revealed plans for a 100,000-capacity stadium.           
Guangzhou mirror crisis in Chinese football
Guangzhou's rapid ascent began when property developers China Evergrande bought the club in 2010 
when it was in the Chinese second tier.          
The new ownership group renamed the side Guangzhou Evergrande and invested heavily on and off the pitch,
 aligning with China president Xi Jinping's ambition to turn the country into a football superpower that could
 host - and win - the World Cup.           
Italy's World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi was appointed manager in 2012 and masterminded three CSL titles,
 a Chinese FA Cup and the AFC Champions League.           
Luiz Felipe Scolari, who led Brazil to World Cup glory in 2002, was even more successful, winning
seven trophies in two-and-a-half years.           
Former Tottenham and Barcelona midfielder Paulinho, ex-Italy striker Alberto Gilardino and former Colombia 
forward Jackson Martinez were among the foreign stars to arrive for big transfer fees and equally large wages.            
But Guangzhou were far from alone in their enormous spending.            
An array of international players moved to China as the CSL sought to compete with powerhouses such as the
 Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and Bundesliga.            
Brazil striker Hulk joined Shanghai SIPG, who were managed by former England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson, for 
£46m.            
Chelsea midfielder Oscar soon followed for £60m while ex-Manchester City and United striker Carlos Tevez moved
 to Shanghai Shenhua for a reported £40m.            
All were on huge wages and in 2016 Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said the money spent on players by Chinese
 clubs was a "danger for all teams in the world".            
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger added that "China looks to have the financial power to move a whole European league
 to China".           
In 2019, Real Madrid's Gareth Bale - at one point the most expensive player in the world - was linked with a 
move to Jiangsu Suning on wages worth £1m-a-week.

        <h3>Chinese Super League 2021 to kick off without defending champions Jiangsu FC - get matchweek 1 
            fixtures</h3>
        <p>The Chinese Super League 2021 season will start on Tuesday, April 20 without defending champions 
Jiangsu FC who have been denied a team licence for the new campaign.
Jiangsu FC defeated Guangzhou Evergrande in a playoff in November last year to secure their 
first-ever league title. However, Jiangsu FC owners Suning announced they had ceased operations at
the end of February.           
Meanwhile, Jiangsu have been replaced in the Chinese Super League (CSL) by Cangzhou Mighty Lions.         
The 16 Chinese Super League teams have been divided into two groups - A and B. Group A includes eight-time 
winners Guangzhou FC, Chinese FA Cup champions Shandong Taishan, Guangzhou City, Shenzhen FC, Chongqing 
Athletic, Henan Songshan Longmen, Qingdao FC and Cangzhou Lions.          
Group B comprises Beijing Guoan, 2018 champions Shanghai Port, Shanghai Shenhua, Hebei FC, Tianjin Tigers,
 Dalian Pro, Changchun Yatai and Wuhan FC.          
The first phase of the CSL season will be played in the southern city of Guangzhou and the other
half in Suzhou, near Shanghai. The players will be forced to stay in a biosecure bubble for the league.         
The new Chinese Super League campaign will kick off with the Guangzhou derby as Guangzhou FC host Guangzhou
 City FC at the Tianhe Stadium on Tuesday, April 20.           
Guangzhou FC had finished runners-up last season, while Guangzhou City ended the campaign in 11th spot.          
Oscar, Marko Arnautovic, Marouane Fellaini, Mousa Dembele and Paulinho are some of the big names that will
 feature in the upcoming edition of the CSL.

<h1>Alex Eala barges into main draw of WTA Guangzhou Open </h1>
   
<p>Filipina tennister Alex Eala has seemingly recovered from back-to-back early exits in China, entering the
    main draw of the Guangzhou Open, a WTA 250 tournament.
    Philippine tennis sensation Alex Eala broke through on Monday, October 21, as she entered the main draw of
     the WTA Guangzhou Open, winning her second qualifying match in straight sets.
     After edging out home bet Gao Xinyu in a three-set marathon on Sunday, Eala delivered a more dominant 
     showing against Elena Pridankina in her final qualifying match, 6-2, 6-2, to get herself going in China.
Prior to her twin victories in Guangzhou, it was two disappointing outings for the 19-year-old at the Wuhan 
and Ningbo Open as she exited in the Round of 64 and qualifiers, respectively, in the singles tournament.
Before being a wild card entry in Wuhan, she previously made the main draw of a WTA tournament last September 
in Guadalajara, where she fell in the Round of 32.
Now with a chance to end her China stint on a high before returning to Manila for a break, the Rafa Nadal
 Academy Scholar will look to make a deep run in the WTA 250 tournament.
She faces a field of players led by 1-seed Katerina Siniakova of Czechia, who is ranked 48th in the world in 
singles. She is the no. 1 player in women’s doubles.
Siniakova was the one who beat Eala in the Round of 64 in Wuhan.
Eala’s next foe has yet to be determined as the final day of qualifying is still playing out.
