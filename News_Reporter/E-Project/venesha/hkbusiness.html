        <h3>Hong Kong banks may cut rate to record low 5% in 2025, benefiting property and economy</h3>
        <p>After the US Federal Reserve and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) cut their key policy rate by a
full percentage point in 2024, at least two more rates are possible next year, according to analysts. Hong Kong
 banks, meanwhile, may further cut their lending rate to a historical low of 5 per cent, which would benefit 
 the economy and property sector, they added. The market expects the Fed to hit pause on rate cuts in the first
  half of 2025, followed by two or three reductions in the second half for a combined 50 to 75 basis points,
   according to 10 analysts polled by the Post. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from
    around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers,
     FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. "The US next year will continue 
to cut rates, but the pace and frequency of rate cuts may be less than initially expected," Eddie Yue 
Wai-man, the CEO of HKMA, said on December 19. Hong Kong's de facto central bank cut its base rate to
4.75 per cent, the lowest since December 2022, after the Fed cut its rate by the same amount to a range of 
4.25 to 4.50 per cent. Both institutions reduced their key rate by a full percentage point in 2024, while
 local commercial banks cut their prime rate, the lending rate offered to their best customers, by 62.5 basis 
 points. However, the Fed's rate outlook was hawkish, suggesting only two cuts in 2025. "The [Fed's rate cut]
  decision will depend on the inflation and unemployment rates, as well as the overall economic environment," 
  said Eric Tso Tak-ming, chief vice-president of mortgage broker mReferral. "If the inflation continues to be
   controlled, the Fed may cut interest rates at least three times, bringing the rate down to 3.75 per cent
    next year. Hong Kong lenders may follow and cut their prime rate." Bank of China (Hong Kong), HSBC and its
     subsidiary Hang Seng Bank have set their prime rate at 5.25 per cent, while it currently stands at 5.5
      per cent at Bank of East Asia, Standard Chartered and ICBC Asia.

        <h3>Hong Kong’s MTR Corp exploring new business model to meet HK$165 billion commitment</h3>
        <p> Hong Kong’s MTR Corporation (MTRC) has been exploring ways to cut costs and diversify income 
streams as it seeks to fulfil an investment commitment amounting to HK$165 billion over the next
decade, local media have reported.
Citing an MTRC source, multiple outlets reported on Friday that the railway giant was seeking new income sources
 beyond its “rail-plus-property” business model, given the struggling property market.
The current model refers to the MTRC using income from developing properties above stations to fund railway
 projects, as well as its operations and maintenance.
 But the property market in Hong Kong has remained weak in recent years and an MTRC development project at the 
 planned Tung Chung East station failed to attract any bidders in November 2023.
The railway operator halved the size of the project to about 600 flats and eventually awarded it to developer
 Nan Fung Group last month.
Meanwhile, the MTRC has pledged to invest HK$65 billion in renewing and repairing its railway assets between
 2023 and 2027, according to the company’s 2024 interim report.
 Railway projects currently in the early stages of planning or construction were expected to cost HK$100
  billion, according to local media reports.
 Such projects include Kwu Tung Station on the East Rail Line, Hung Shui Kiu Station on the Tuen Ma Line,
  Oyster Bay Station on the Tung Chung Line, and the Tuen Mun South Extension – all planned to be completed by
   2034.
   The HK$165 billion combined costs are roughly equivalent to the MTRC’s market capitalisation as the stock
    market closed on Thursday, at HK$26.5 a share.
The MTRC source said new investment plans could cost over HK$200 billion if accounting for the Northern Link 
and the South Island Line extension, which would be “double the size of the current MTRC market 
capitalisation,” according to Ming Pao.

        <h3>Hong Kong to launch overseas campaign advertising city as ‘best place in Asia,’ following US$5.7m PR consultation  </h3>         
        <p> The government is set to roll out an overseas campaign later this year to promote Hong Kong as the
“best place in Asia to live, work and invest in.” It came as the official publicity unit said it 
had no plans to hire new consultancy firms to help the government “relaunch” the city following 
the 2019 protests and unrest, and the Covid-19 pandemic.
In a legislative meeting on Wednesday, pro-establishment lawmaker Regina Ip asked the government 
to provide details of the work done by global PR firm Consulum FZ LLC (Consulum), after it was 
awarded a one-year contract last June to advise the government on its “Relaunch Hong Kong” 
initiative. 
Secretary for Home Affairs Caspar Tsui said in a written reply that the contract with Consulum, valued at
 around US$6.4 million (HK$49.8 million), had expired on July 30. During the retainment period, the company –
  which controversially did publicity work for Saudi Arabia – conducted market research that found Hong Kong
   to be a “cosmopolitan, diverse, dynamic and connected” city.
   “The research showed that… Hong Kong was the only Asian city that… [has] access to markets in mainland
    China and Asia; [provides] a sophisticated and secure pro-business platform; and a cosmopolitan lifestyle,” 
    the minister wrote.
Consulum designed and tested key publicity messages, Tsui said, including advertising the city as a “safe, 
growing market with considerable potential,” “the ideal springboard to the mainland and Asian markets,” and 
highlighting Hong Kong’s “innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit” and its “cultural richness.”
The government said it saved around US$730,000 (HK$5.68 million) after changes in the promotion strategy and 
implementation timeline, with the final sum payable to the firm being US$5.7 million (HK$44.3 million). But it 
refused to provide a breakdown of the cost of individual tasks as requested by the New People’s Party chair
 Ip, saying the price information was “commercially sensitive.”

<h1>US business chamber fears internet censorship in Hong Kong, urges guarantees on free flow of info</h1>
<p> US businesses in Hong Kong fear mainland Chinese internet curbs and want local authorities to commit to
     the free flow of information, the head of the city’s American Chamber of Commerce said Monday.
Hong Kong has long marketed itself as an international business centre, free from China’s controls and the
“Great Firewall” used to censor online content.
But Beijing has started remoulding the city in its own authoritarian image as it cracks down on dissent
 following huge and often violent pro-democracy protests two years ago.
 A sweeping new security law imposed last year has criminalised much dissent and given authorities a suite of
  new controls, including internet takedown powers.
The latest measure to worry business owners is a proposed privacy law that will hold international tech
 companies and their employees criminally liable for illegal content that users post.
 Tara Joseph, president of the local American Chamber of Commerce, said the government needed to address the 
 business community’s concerns.
“One of the key attributes of Hong Kong is that you can go onto Google, you can go onto Facebook and any other
 platform you want versus what you can do in mainland China,” she told Bloomberg Television. 
 “So I do think it’s important for the government to recognise that and to be open and say we’re going to 
 maintain that free flow of information.”
On Friday, the United States issued a rare advisory, warning businesses of the “growing risks” of operating in
 Hong Kong as China clamps down there.
The advisory highlighted concerns about data privacy, transparency and access to critical business information,
 as well as the risk of breaching US sanctions against Chinese officials and entities.
