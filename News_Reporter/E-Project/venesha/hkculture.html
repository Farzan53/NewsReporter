        <h3>HONG KONG’S WEST KOWLOON CULTURAL DISTRICT THREATENED BY FUNDING CRISIS</h3>
        <p>Hong Kong’s West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD), the massive arts hub that is home to M+, the
Hong Kong Palace Museum, and the Xiqu Centre for Chinese opera, will have to cut museum opening 
hours if the government does not address its looming funding crisis by August. Speaking with 
iCable News on May 18, WKCD board chairman Henry Tang said the district had submitted a financial
plan to authorities aimed at generating revenue for the cash-strapped hub, which is facing 
possible bankruptcy, but had not yet received a reply. Occupying a 99-acre wedge of land bordering Victoria
 Harbor, the WKCD was established in 2008 with a HK$21.6 billion ($2.7 billion) endowment, the lion’s share of
  which was earmarked for infrastructure. Beset by construction delays, cost surges, and the Covid-19 crisis,
   the district saw losses increase from HK$869 million ($111 million) in 2021 to HK$1.56 billion 
   ($199 million) the following year. Tang last August sounded the alarm regarding an imminent cash crunch, 
   warning that funds could run out by June 2025 if measures were not taken, severely hampering the ability on
    the part of the district’s institutions to plan exhibitions and programming. Among the proposals the WKCD
has floated to Hong Kong’s Culture, Sports, and Tourism Bureau are reviewing service charges, raising 
ticket prices and venue rental fees, and selling off land. According to ArtAsiaPacific, the bureau is 
seeking independent counsel on the matter but has not yet approved any of the proposals. Should they fail
to do so, the WKCD would be forced to reduce the number of days per week that the museums are open from 
six to four and to limit the operating hours of the opera house. “But will this be fair to the public?” 
Tang asked in the May 18 radio interview. “After all, this is not a commercial undertaking but a key 
public policy project.” Tang posited that reducing opening days could negatively impact the city’s 
attempt to establish itself as an international cultural hub.</p>

        <h3>Hong Kong lights up for Lumières festival</h3>
        <p> The three-night show, which launched Thursday, saw light creations beamed onto some of Hong Kong’s 
landmark heritage buildings, with other installations brightening shopping areas and parks.
Local artist Keith Lam said the festival went some way to addressing Hong Kong’s lack of publicly accessible 
artworks.
“The streets and the public spaces in Hong Kong are so tight and dense and there are so many people, so it’s a 
challenge to do public art,” Lam told AFP.
Hong Kong currently lacks a world class art museum, and marquee exhibitions rarely make a stop in the southern
 Chinese city, where graffiti by high-profile artists is often removed and it can be difficult to secure
  permission for public shows.
  Lam, a new media artist, displayed his “Heliocentric” installation which featured a three dimensional
   combination of rings laced with LED lights at the PMQ, a former police residence turned creative hub.
   Passersby said the installations were a welcome relief in a busy city.
   “I think it’s great for the whole culture, and also for everyone who is getting off work and able to 
   embrace so much art in front of them,” said one visitor to the illuminated bamboo display in central Statue
    Square.
    The Lyon festival, which started in the 19th century, will take place in early December, with light 
    displays adorning the French city’s streets, public squares and bridges.

        <h3>Behind the scenes of Hong Kong’s new music festival, Weekend </h3>         
        <p>Taking place this weekend at the West Kowloon Cultural District is a music festival that is
promoting itself under a rather unusual banner – “local.” A quick glance at the lineup and you 
will find that very single band playing at the event is from Hong Kong, with no overseas 
headliners. Even the stages carry a local flavour and are named according to the districts in the city – 
Kowloon, Hong Kong, and New Territories.
The festival is a two-day event that will feature not only music performances, but also installation art by 
new media artist Keith Lam, creative unit Start From Zero, and multimedia creator KS – as well as a food court
 with traditional snacks such as dim sum, egg waffles and put chai kos.
 The official host organiser of festival is wow and flutter, a platform created by music veteran Hong Ka-chun 
 that aims to promote and connect individuals and units working on different independent projects. This
  includes, but is not limited to, projects on music. “The Weekend will be wow and flutter’s first event, and 
  naturally a lot of the units, be it the market or the bands, they are locals – Hongkongers.”
  But Hong said that “local” was not a so-called selling point of the festival; in fact, he expressed worries
   over the associations others would put on the word – political or otherwise.
“The worst would be if people think we’re piggybacking on this. In my opinion, we’re each doing our own thing.
 In all these years that I’ve been working in the indie music scene, the most important spirit of independent
  music is that we can all do all our own thing without being held accountable to, say, our bosses, and we can
   say what we want. That should be the best part about the community… and that’s what I want The Weekend to
    be like as well. ”

<h1>New art mural adorning Hong Kong’s Pak Shing temple attracts barrage of criticism</h1>
<p> A new mural at on the outer wall of the Kwong Fuk Ancestral Hall in Sheung Wan has attracted a barrage of
    criticism from citizens.
   Commonly known as Pak Shing Temple, the hall houses the tablets of mainland Chinese who worked and died in 
    Hong Kong, and is a Grade II heritage building.  
    The mural was produced by i-dArt, an initiative of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals which promotes artists 
    with disabilities and social inclusion through art. The colourful mural was designed by Cheng Ka-yan, a 
    local artist who makes collages with scraps of paper, often writing out phrases that appeal to her,
according to i-dArt’s website. 
The mural features brightly coloured and patterned shapes on a black background. Names of deities, the Tung Wah
 Group, and common phrases said during prayer are written on the wall in brightly-coloured rectangles.
The new wall is part of the temple’s reconstruction. Previously, the entrance was a red wall with words meaning
 sacred place in its centre.
The group posted a photo of the mural on its Facebook account on Wednesday and asked people to visit, check in
 on social media, and take selfies with the artwork. Since then, the post has attracted hundreds of comments
  and angry emoji.
Commenters slammed the charity for not respecting the heritage building and asked for the wall to be restored 
to its original state.
“The Pak Shing Temple is a solemn Buddhist site, the design of Buddhist facilities have specific traditional 
elements and colours. Randomly adding in “new” designs lacks dignity and ruins the solemness of the place,” 
said one commenter.
Another said: “It’s gross, can we not keep making Hong Kong so ugly?”
Another commenter said: “I’m very dissatisfied! My ancestors’ tablets are in there! I thought it would only be
 a new 
coat of paint, who knew it would become like this?”
Katty Law, convenor of the Central and Western Concern Group, told Inmedia that the design looked incongruous.
 “It’s not that I don’t accept new modes of art or graffiti, but the wall was originally already quite 
 stylish.”
She questioned the guidelines followed by the organisers, and said that Tung Wah should have undergone 
consultation and made its decision based on the standards applicable to a monument.
