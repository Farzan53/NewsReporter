        <h3>Mental health care in Hong Kong suffers from stigma and shortages. 4 groups are helping</h3>
        <p>Charlotte Chan had professional care for her mental health issues. Many in Hong Kong face a long
wait. Four groups have stepped up to help
When Charlotte Chan laced up her shoes to run 62 kilometres (39 miles) around Hong Kong Island in
2022, she was not just preparing for a physical challenge. She was setting out on a mission. 
Having been diagnosed with depression and anxiety when she was younger, as well as witnessing the
impact of suicide on families and communities, the 25-year-old was keen to raise awareness of 
and support for mental health. The Weez Walk, an annual fundraising running/walking event
organised by non-profit organisations the Weez Project and KELY Support Group, provided a
meaningful way for Chan to do this. The funds raised go towards supporting mental health and 
suicide prevention programmes. “With professional care and the support of family and friends, 
I was able to recover,” says the dentist of her own mental health journey, adding that it also 
took resilience and courage. But many people in Hong Kong do not have access to the same
resources, Chan notes. “The stigma surrounding mental illness makes speaking up incredibly 
hard.” In Hong Kong, mental health issues are a growing concern across all age groups. A 2023
study by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that nearly one in four children and 
adolescents suffered from at least one mental disorder in the past year, placing Hong Kong 
at the high end of a global trend.  </p>

        <h3>Severe shortage of doctors in Hong Kong prompts new plan to plug holes in city’s health system</h3>
        <p>A chronic shortage of doctors has prompted Hong Kong health chiefs to propose a new pathway for 
non-locally trained doctors to be cleared to work in the city’s public healthcare sector.
Officials from Food and Health Bureau on Tuesday said the move was necessary to plug what they 
described as a “severe shortage” of doctors and to meet an increasing demand for public healthcare 
services due to the city’s ageing population.
The bureau estimates the shortage will worsen in the coming years, with the projected shortfall of healthcare
 manpower reaching 1,610 in 2030 and 1,949 in 2040. The city currently has a ratio of two doctors per 1,000 
 people.
 Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said Hong Kong needed to tap into non-locally trained medical
  personnel to bolster its public health system because previous attempts to increase local training places
   and retain doctors in the public health sector have not been able to alleviate the shortage.
 Under the government’s proposal, doctors who have qualified abroad and want to apply for the “special 
 registration” pathway must satisfy four conditions, which include being a Hong Kong permanent resident, being
  registered abroad and holding a medical qualification from a list of approved overseas institutions.
  Potential applicants must also have worked full-time for at least five years at public institutions under 
  the Hospital Authority or the Department of Health. They must also be considered to have been competent 
  during that period of employment.
A list of overseas qualifications recognised under the new pathway will be determined by a new Special 
Registration Committee, which will take into account the medical school’s instruction medium, curriculum, and 
international ranking, Chan said.

        <h3>Plastic policies: Reducing microplastic pollution is an urgent environmental, biological and human health issue</h3>
        <p>In 1972, the journal Science published a paper, Plastics on the Sargasso Sea Surface, detailing the 
abundance of pellet-shaped plastics less than a centimetre in diameter, floating on the surface of
the Western Sargasso Sea. It was the first paper on microplastics. The authors accurately 
predicted that increasing production of plastics, combined with then-present waste disposal
practices, would lead to microplastics pollution outbreaks.
Almost 40 years on, tiny particles of plastic of less than 5mm are extremely widespread on Hong
Kong shores. A study by The Hong Kong Institute of Education surveyed 25 beaches – they found 
around 140,000 pieces of microplastic; 50% higher than similar studies done in South Korea, and 7
times more than Easter Island, in the Pacific Ocean. Microplastics arise from fragmentation of
macroplastics or are added directly to the environment in micro form, for example as “nurdles” 
plastic pellets_ or microbeads, as found in facial scrubs. Readers may remember the Sinopec 
pellet spill in 2012 here in Hong Kong. They pose dangers to marine organisms at the base of 
food chains, such as zooplankton, causing mortality, false-satiation, and a host of other 
biological effects.
At the very top of the food chain are humans. Worryingly, the short- and long-term effects of microplastics on
 human health and safety are unknown, due to their relatively recent scientific observation. Regardless, 
 ecological effects abound – microplastics are a surface for new algal communities, affecting ecosystem 
 function by providing alternative artificial habitats, food sources, and compositions of species.  Thus, 
 their presence is a pressing environmental, biological and human health issue. Having our beaches constantly
  littered with trash, tiny pieces of polystyrene and other plastic litter is also highly undesirable.

<h1>‘Test Hong Kong gov’t for racism’ says migrant coalition, as mass Covid testing of domestic workers yet to yield cases
    </h1>
<p>The government’s controversial order that all Hong Kong foreign domestic workers must be tested for the 
    coronavirus has yielded no new cases so far, the Food and Health Bureau announced on Sunday evening.
    Over the weekend, thousands of domestic workers queued for hours on their day off to undergo a Covid-19
     test.
     As of 6pm on Sunday, around 54,000 of the 113,000 samples collected over the weekend had been tested, with
      no new infections discovered. More than 52,000 samples had been collected from foreign domestic workers 
      in all.
      For local cases with unknown sources of infection involving mutant strains, the government has to be
       decisive in adopting swiftly stringent testing and quarantine measures, with an aim [of] cutting the 
       transmission chains as soon as possible,” a Food and Health Bureau spokesperson said on Sunday.
        “Otherwise, the whole society will have to bear significant consequences when there is a major outbreak.”
People found to have violated a compulsory testing order face a fine of HK$5,000 and an additional testing order. 
Those who fail to observe a second order face a fine of up to HK$25,000 and six months imprisonment.
The compulsory testing order drew strong criticism from rights groups over the weekend, who decried the 
government’s measures as “racist.”
“‘If migrant domestic workers are being asked to submit themselves to get tested for Covid-19, we think the
 Hong Kong government authorities should also submit themselves to get tested for racism,” a spokesperson for
  a coalition of 12 foreign domestic worker groups, the Asian Migrants’ Coordinating Body, said in a statement 
  on Sunday.
  “This decision to mandate testing for the 370,000 migrant domestic workers simply because of their job is 
  absurd and the latest in a string of discriminatory policies of the government.”
