        <h3>Hong Kong Bar Association to pick new leaders with veteran set to helm body</h3>
        <p>he Hong Kong Bar Association will undergo a change of leadership this month, with seasoned barrister
Jose-Antonio Maurellet set to helm the body, succeeding Victor Dawes after a three-year stint. 
According to an internal circular sent to association members on Friday, senior counsel Maurellet,
currently a vice-chairman, has been nominated as the new head of the professional body for the city’s 
barristers. Two senior counsel, Martin Hui Siu-ting, who resigned from the Department of Justice as deputy
 director of public prosecutions in 2019 and entered private practice, and Eva Sit Yat-wah, have been proposed
  as vice-chairs of the association. Chairman Dawes expressed confidence in the new line-up, which members
   will vote on at the association’s annual general meeting on January 23. “I am delighted that in line with 
   our fine tradition, the bar will be led by senior members of the Inner Bar who are respected by the 
   profession,” he told the Post. “I have every confidence the new leadership will maintain the commitment to
    our fundamental principle with the ability to retain the trust of all interested parties.” Dawes took over
     the reins of the legal body in 2022 at a time when its relationship with Beijing had hit a low point.</p>

        <h3>Hong Kong Bar Association should not discuss politics, new chairman says </h3>
        <p> he Hong Kong Bar Association should not handle or discuss political issues, the newly-elected
chairman Victor Dawes has said, as the senior counsel vowed to safeguard the city’s rule of law
which “is not dead.”
Barristers in Hong Kong elected Dawes on Thursday night to fill the shoes of Senior Council Paul
Harris who faced strong criticism from Beijing during his term last year. The former leader was
accused of politicising the professional body, while pro-establishment figures called him a 
“liability” and an “existential threat” to the group.
Speaking to the press after the annual general meeting, Dawes faced questions about how he would tackle
 criticism that the Bar Association was politicised. In response, the new leader said the group has a duty to 
 speak up on issues related to the rule of law, but the rule of law “was not a political concept.”
 “The Bar Association is a professional body. On issues related to the rule of law, we have the social 
 responsibility to speak up. But when it comes to politics… these topics should not be what the Bar Association
  should handle or discuss,” Dawes said, while standing alongside senior counsels Derek Chan and Jose-Antonio 
  Maurellet who were elected as the new vice-chiefs. They faced no competition in the election.
Dawes, who specialises in commercial litigation and chancery disputes, added that the group will “grasp” the
 difference between social and political issues in the coming year as there may be areas where the two 
 overlapped.

        <h3>83 politicians, activists and organisations condemn passing of new Hong Kong security law</h3>
        <p>Ninety politicians and organisations from across the world have issued a joint statement condemning
Beijing’s passing of a national security law for Hong Kong. They called on countries to impose
Magnitsky-style sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials complicit in the passing of the new 
legislation, and urged the implementation of “lifeboat” schemes for Hongkongers who may now face political 
persecution.
The undersigned jointly condemn the unilateral decision of the Chinese National People’s Congress in 
introducing national security legislation on Hong Kong. This is the latest of a series of escalating 
violations of China’s international obligations on Hong Kong, and we call on the international community to
stand with Hong Kong, to defend the city’s fundamental freedoms, human rights, rule of law, and autonomy.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress discussed the national security legislation for Hong
 Kong, without any scrutiny by the local legislature and in contravention of Hong Kong’s constitution. The
  legislation fails to clearly define criminal offences that it purports to regulate, and reinforces grave 
  concerns that it will not conform with nor be subjected to Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of 
  Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
  Beijing’s imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong has effectively transformed Hong Kong’s “One 
  Country, Two Systems” framework into “One Country, One System”. It follows China’s incessant erosion of the 
  freedoms and rights guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong since the 1997 transfer of sovereignty. China’s 
  flagrant breach of its international obligations, particularly those under the 1984 Sino-British Joint 
  Declaration, has severely damaged trust in its willingness to be a responsible global actor under the
   rules-based international order.

<h1>The Hong Kong gov’t’s new, poisonous political culture: All criticism is politics, all critics are
    ill  </h1>
  
<p> Recently, having returned to writing after a two year hiatus, I began to receive hate mail. I had 
    given an interview in which I spoke, in English, of my decision to leave Hong Kong. It was a highly
     emotional interview, as Hong Kong is the only home I have known and the decision has been the most 
     difficult of my life.
I received a flurry of racial and anti-Anglophone abuse. My part-Chinese ancestry and my roots in Hong Kong 
count for nothing. I am part of a “colonial legacy” that should never have been allowed to take root; my 
“existence represents national humiliation”; and I cannot and do not belong on Chinese soil. Thus my decision
was meaningless, and my heartache irrelevant.
But what hurts far more than the comments themselves is knowing that much of the abuse is state sponsored.
Almost anyone writing on China or on areas in which Beijing has interests will be bombarded with similar 
abuse from “wu mao” (50 cent) – an army hundreds of thousands if not millions strong paid by our national
government half a yuan for each such posting.
What would in many countries constitute hate crime is now sponsored by my own state. It is yet another
example of a change so many people in Hong Kong have experienced which does not appear in any official
record; the state no longer serves as our protector but is the source of our oppression.
Feeling hurt I turned to a close relative. I messaged her that I was pained by the racist and anti-anglophone
nature of the comments. I expected to receive a call. Even if nothing could be done, a supportive line would
help emotionally – a confirmation of my moral sensibility. The reply came:
I am not interested in politics.
