        <h3>FC Barcelona plans July match in Hong Kong, venue application at Kai Tak Sports Park rejected</h3>
        <p>(Hong Kong) FC Barcelona is scheduled to play in Hong Kong on 27th July this year. However, the
event is facing uncertainty after Winman Advertising and Entertainment Group announced today that
their application to rent Kai Tak Sports Park has been denied. The sports park stated that they
requested the necessary documentation from the organisers, but none has been received to date. 
The organisers indicated that the match would feature several international stars, and they are
calling on Kai Tak Sports Park to reconsider their venue application. Winman Advertising also 
mentioned that if the event proceeds, they plan to distribute half of the training day tickets
for free to underprivileged families and communities on 26th July, fostering a love for sports. Additionally, 
10% of the match tickets will be priced at HK$80 to ensure accessibility for all demographics. Kai Tak Sports 
Park has confirmed that they did receive an inquiry from the advertising group regarding the venue rental but 
have yet to receive the required application documents. Earlier reports suggested that the venue’s refusal may
 be due to a prior booking by another prominent team, Liverpool, who are expected to visit Asia for pre-season 
 matches. Sports magazine The Athletic previously reported that Liverpool has yet to decide between Hong Kong 
 and Japan for their fixtures, with Kai Tak Sports Park being a potential location if they choose Hong Kong.

        <h3>Hong Kong sports teams told to boycott ceremonies if organiser refuses national anthem check under new guidelines</h3>
        <p> Hong Kong sports teams are now required to boycott medal ceremonies at international competitions 
if the organiser refuses to let the team leader verify the Chinese national anthem or regional
flags on site, according to amended guidelines issued by the top sports federation representing 
Hong Kong at the Olympics.
The move came after the 2019 protest song Glory to Hong Kong was played instead of China’s March of the
 Volunteers at several international sporting ceremonies attend by Hong Kong athletes.
In a statement published on Tuesday, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC)
 said that the new guidelines will come to effect on Thursday. There was also a briefing session conducted by 
 SF&OC on Tuesday attended by over 230 representatives of the member associations.
 In the amended guidelines, the SF&OC said:” The local event organisers had downloaded the wrong song through
  Google search or YouTube which placed the wrong song as the top search result. Google and YouTube are hence 
  proven to be totally unreliable in the search for the correct National Anthem of Hong Kong, China Teams.”
The government only launched an English-language web page with anthem details in April, months after the
 anthem row erupted.
According to the updated guidelines, the member sports associations – also known as National Sports
 Associations (NSAs) – will now have to collect an anthem toolkit from SF&OC every time before setting off for 
 international sports events. The SF&OC will provide two regional flags, two hard copies of the anthem – either
  computer disks or a USB drive – as well as an acknowledgement receipt for the organisers to sign.
Aside from the hard copies, before departure, the associations will have to provide the event organiser with 
the official web link to the national anthem’s recording, as well as the correct specifications of the regional
 flag.

        <h3>Hong Kong Cyclothon and cross-harbour swim race to return amid Covid-19, but Rugby Sevens postponed  </h3>         
        <p>The Hong Kong Cyclothon and the New World Harbour Race will return to the city after they were
suspended for two years owing to the 2019 protests and the subsequent Covid-19 pandemic.
The Tourism Board announced on Wednesday that the cycling event will be held at the Hong Kong port
of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge for the first time on January 16 next year. It will be
limited to 3,000 local participants only and they will be required to be fully vaccinated at least two weeks
 before the competition.
Cyclists must also receive a Covid-19 nucleic acid test carried out by the organisers within 48 hours before
 the race, but they are allowed to remove their face masks during the competition. A total of 1,000 places are
  offered for the 48 km race, which costs HK$750 for registration. Meanwhile, up to 2,000 people may join the
   26 km ride costing HK$500.
   imilar Covid-19 regulations will be imposed at the cross-harbour swimming race, which will take place on
    December 12. This year’s race will allow up to 1,200 contenders, who will follow a new route, diving in at
    the public pier next to Wan Chai Golden Bauhinia Square to reach the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui.
Swimmers are required to complete two doses of Covid-19 vaccination at least 14 days before the event. They
also need to take a free Covid-19 test arranged by the organiser and receive a negative result within 48 hours
 before the race.
 They must scan the official Covid-19 contact-tracing LeaveHomeSafe app for accessing the venue, as well as
  sign a health declaration form to ensure they have not left Hong Kong in the 21 days before the race.
People may sign up for the race online starting at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday. Water tests are expected to take 
place at the end of this month after the organisers draw lots.
The Cyclothon and the cross-harbour race scheduled in October 2019 were cancelled amid citywide unrest sparked
 by the ill-fated extradition bill. They were scrapped again last year as Hong Kong was struggling to curb the
  spread of Covid-19.

<h1>Hong Kong Kin-ball heads to the World Cup, but struggles for recognition back home</h1>
<p> Kin-Ball is a new sport in Hong Kong, though has been played in other territories for decades. Not
    yet recognised as a traditional sport, the Hong Kong Kin-Ball Association faces difficulties with
    venue booking and is struggling to develop the sport owing to the lack of public and governmental
    support.
    Harriet Lai and Tina To followed one of the members of the Hong Kong team, from his workplace, to practice 
    sessions, and to the Kin-Ball World Cup held in Tokyo, Japan, last November.
