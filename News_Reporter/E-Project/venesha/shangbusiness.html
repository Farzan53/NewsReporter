        <h3>China Shanghai composite index ends 0.71% higher</h3>
        <p>Asian stocks ended mixed on Tuesday as U.S.-China tensions and jitters around the yuan offset 
growing optimism around chip stocks. The dollar edged down towards one-week low in Asian trade as
investors speculated on the possible outcomes of President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans. 
Gold ticked higher while oil extended overnight losses despite lingering concerns about Russian 
and Iranian supply amid sanctions. China's Shanghai Composite index closed 0.71 percent higher at
3,229.64, reversing early losses after the United States has placed Tencent Holdings Ltd. and 
Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. on a blacklist due to alleged links to the Chinese
military. Chinas foreign exchange reserves fell to $3.2 trillion in December 2024, the lowest 
in eight months, from $3.26 trillion in November. The decline came as the yuan weakened 1.2% 
and the US dollar strengthened 2.6%. Gold reserves edged up to 73.29 million troy ounces, but their value 
dropped to $191.34 billion due to lower gold prices.  </p>

        <h3>Shanghai lays down steps to attract market entities, investments</h3>
        <p> Shanghai will further coordinate investment promotion and business soliciting, introduce new
             investment promotion methods, complete related policies, and come up with one-stop services, 
             according to the set of 15 new measures released on Jan 10.
The new measures were released by the city's leading group for investment promotion work, which was founded at
 the end of last year. Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng serves as the group leader while Hua Yuan and Chen Jie, the 
 city's vice-mayors, serve as the group's deputy heads.           
On one hand, the city will step up the efforts in soliciting new businesses and investment in key areas, 
according to the new measures. By aligning with international high-level economic and trade standards and 
accelerating institutional opening-up, Shanghai aims to attract more market entities with stronger strength in
 allocating global resources and greater market influence.           
More businesses should be introduced to facilitate the development of the three pioneering industries of 
integrated circuit, biomedicine, and artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, the emerging sectors of digital 
economy, green and low-carbon transition, metaverse, and smart devices should also look for more investment. 
Equal attention should also be given to the specific industries including high-tech shipbuilding, home-built
 passenger jet, low-altitude economy, and commercial aviation.

        <h3> Unplug ‘Great Firewall’ to help China compete, Shanghai lawmaker says </h3>         
        <p> A lawmaker in China’s financial hub of Shanghai has called for the lifting of strict internet 
            controls in free-trade zones, financial districts and universities to help support AI development
             and attract foreign investment and talent.
Mao Xiangdong, vice-president of the Shanghai Institute of Technology and a member of the standing committee 
of the municipal people’s congress, proposed the idea during Shanghai’s ongoing legislative sessions, according
 to a post by China Development News, a newspaper under the National Development and Reform Commission.
It is not clear when the post was put online but it was removed on Friday morning.            
Shanghai should “continue to learn new technologies from developed countries”, Mao said, according to Toutiao,
 a popular news and information aggregation site.           
He added that the mission of building China into an international economic, financial, trade, shipping, science
 and tech innovation centre – as envisioned by President Xi Jinping – required “global exchanges”.
During an inspection trip to the city in December 2023, Xi discussed a “five-centres goal”, in which Shanghai 
should be a global hub based on the economy, finance, trade, shipping, and scientific and technological 
innovation. The plan became a trending political and economic vision for the city.

<h1>China Shanghai composite index end marginally lower</h1>
<p> Asian stocks ended Tuesday's session on a mixed note as U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to
impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and said tariffs on China could hinge on a deal 
over TikTok's ownership.
The dollar fell and gold hit a ten-week high after Trump held off from imposing sweeping trade tariffs in his
 first day in office and announced a national energy emergency in order to end the inflation crisis.   
Oil prices traded mixed in Asian trade in the wake of Trump's plan to boost oil and gas production in the 
United States and lower costs for consumers. 
China's Shanghai Composite index ended marginally lower at 3,242.62 after a choppy session.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 0.91 percent to 20,106.55, with property developers in focus after Bloomberg
 reported that officials are taking steps to stabilize operations at China Vanke Co.
