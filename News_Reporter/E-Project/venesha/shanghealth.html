        <h3>Bayer opens consumer health innovation center in Shanghai</h3>
        <p>Bayer launched its latest consumer health innovation center in Shanghai on Wednesday with an 
estimated investment of 20 million euros (US$21.83 million) to promote open partnerships with 
industry players. The China Center of Innovation and Partnership (CCIP), one of Bayer Consumer
Health's global strategic innovation hubs across Europe, the UK, and the US, is the first one in
Asia. 
The Shanghai Innovation (SH-INNO) Park in the Zhangjiang of ​​Pudong New Area is home to the new facility of the
 German life science and health-care company, which is ready to accelerate innovation research and development 
 to explore more self-care solutions suitable for Chinese consumers. David Evendon Challis, chief scientific 
 officer & chief marketing officer of Bayer Consumer Health, said that "We expect this type of collaboration 
 model in Shanghai to serve as a flagship and a role model for other regions around the globe." It will utilize
  the infrastructure of Shanghai Pharma-backed SH-INNO, a life science innovation incubator, to fully leverage
   the geographical advantages, industry influence, and market network to allow the company to better work with
    local partners and drive project implementation. Bayer's consumer health division currently ranks China as
     its second-largest market and anticipates it to grow at the fastest rate in the next three to five years.
      The vibrant economic and social landscape of China presents unique opportunities to improve and expand 
self-care solutions. "We greatly value the innovation-friendly environment fostered by the local
government, which allows us to collaborate with local partners and tap into the strong talent pool," said 
Arturo Sanchez, head of commercial operations of Bayer Consumer Health Asia-Pacific and Latin America .

        <h3>Shanghai to enhance community healthcare centers</h3>
        <p>Shanghai will elevate the role of the community healthcare centers to comprehensively build up 
            their capacities in basic medical treatment, rehabilitation, public health services and health
             management, said Wen Daxiang, director of Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health, at a news 
             conference on Jan 17.
On average, each center is expected to be equipped with 682 types of medicines, marking an increase of 66 
types or about 82.6 percent of commonly used medications for common and chronic diseases used in second- and 
third-tier hospitals.
At the same time, the city will prioritize opening registration slots at second- and third-tier hospitals to 
patients recommended by community healthcare centers, Wen said.
Additionally, the city will improve healthcare for key populations, including the elderly, children, and those
 with mental health or chronic conditions, through special initiatives such as nutrition improvement, cognitive
  disorders prevention, and mental health services.           
Efforts will also be made to expand healthcare services by advancing chronic diseases management, enhancing 
pediatric and mental health care, improving hospital facilities, and increasing the availability of automated
 defibrillator devices.          
"Shanghai is aiming to improve healthcare accessibility, quality, and infrastructure to show its care and 
contribute to a healthier city," said Wen.  
a higher level, he said that Shanghai will move forward to enhance its medical standards by advancing the 
construction of national medical centers and key clinical specialties. The city will expand capacity of 
regional medical centers and build district-level demonstration hospitals.
More importantly, it is set to integrate resources within medical alliances for unified drug catalogs and 
standardized services. It will also establish centers for collaborative traditional Chinese and Western 
medicine treatment of complex diseases and further develop community-based traditional Chinese medicine 
services.
Last but not the least, he noted that Shanghai will enhance its public health service system in building a 
etwork that will effectively alert on risks of infectious diseases. It will also make the system ready for 
responding to health emergencies with medical treatments and resources as well as other preparations.

        <h3>Singaporean woman celebrates triumph over cancer with CAR-T cell therapy in Shanghai  </h3>         
        <p> A Singaporean patient is celebrating the one-year anniversary of her full recovery from a rare 
type of lymphoma after receiving treatment at Shanghai's Jiahui International Hospital.
Lyn, a 17-year resident of Shanghai, said that receiving treatment in here was the best decision 
that she made. To celebrate the one-year anniversary of her recovery, she went on a diving trip to
the Republic of Palau.
Diagnosed with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma at the age of 40, Lyn had a 15-centmeter
tumor between her heart and lung, which caused great pain and affected other organs as well as 
large vessels.
She first went through six rounds of chemotherapy once every three weeks. She experienced weight 
loss, hair loss and vomiting during the treatment. Lyn then received 20 radiotherapy treatments, 
as well as immunotherapy, but only saw temporary improvement.
She once again felt hopeful again when, in June 2023, China approved CAR-T cell therapy for her
type of disease. This method of therapy requires a hospital with rich experience in tumor 
treatment and a comprehensive medical team.
The decision was made to continue her treatment in Shanghai as her children go to school in the 
city and the fees are much lower in China, and there would be no waiting period.
It was then that Lyn became the first foreigner to receive Axi-Cel CAR-T treatment in China. The intricate 
process involved the extraction and modification of T cells, the stabilization of her condition, and the
 reinfusion of the engineered CAR-T cells back into her body – a critical phase fraught with risks. Guided by
  a multidisciplinary team of medical experts and the specialized CAR-T nursing unit at the Shanghai hospital,
   Lyn navigated through the complexities of the treatment protocol with fortitude and resilience, culminating
   in her triumphant discharge from the hospital on Sept 13, 2023.

<h1>​New Zealand cancer patient gets a new lease of life in Shanghai</h1>

<p>  After three unsuccessful rounds of chemotherapy back in New Zealand, 57-year-old New Zealander Dale De
     Penning decided to give Shanghai a try to battle his lymphoma, and received advanced CAR-T (chimeric 
     antigen receptor T) cell immunotherapy there.
    At Shanghai SinoUnited Hospital, he achieved complete remission, meaning he was cancer free, after just 
    one month and a checkup three months later confirmed he was cancer free on a PET-CT (positron emission
     tomography - computer tomography) scan.    
    China has become a leading medical center for CAR-T cell immunotherapy, which is specifically developed for
     each patient by reprogramming the patient's own immune cells to target the cancer.   
    Dale chose the hospital in Shanghai after talking with a few others. "The whole treatment is smooth here,"
    he said. "I celebrated my birthday with doctors and nurses ... and I am very grateful to them, who are my 
    friends now. It's a good experience for me. Nobody wants to get cancer, but the treatment here is very 
    successful and gives me new lease of life."   
    "Since China has taken the leading position on CAR-T therapy in the world, we have gained much experience 
    in patient treatment and management to reduce complications and ensure good treatment outcome," said Dr
     Lily Zhou from the Shanghai SinoUnited Hospital, which discharged the New Zealander after his checkup and 
     celebrated his success in beating the disease.
     Currently, there are six CAR-T products approved in the nation and four were either developed or 
     manufactured in Shanghai, drawing many overseas patients to the city for treatment, which offers high
      quality at a competitive price.
CAR-T is a complicated treatment requiring close monitoring and multidisciplinary professionals during patient
 selection, bridging treatment, controlling side effects and symptom management.
"So far, there are six CAR-T options available in China, covering all major targets for various blood diseases.
 China's research and practice of CAR-T are in a leading position, making it a hot destination for international
  patients, while the price here is only about one-fifth that in the United States," said Zhou, chief of
   hematology at SinoUnited Health.
"All our foreign patients are reporting positive effects, which is very encouraging. The Yikaida used on Dale 
is the first approved CAR-T product in China, and it is produced in Shanghai," she said.
Dr Kathy Shi, CEO of SinoUnited Health, said the hospital boasted an international medical team and about 40 
percent of its patients came from overseas.
"So we are very active in attracting international patients and participating in the local government's 
campaign of encouraging international medical tourism, which requires high-quality medical capability, good
 language ability and patient-centered service, including picking up patients at the airport, food, cultural 
 background, a multidisciplinary medical team and competitive price," Shi said.
"All our medical perspectives are designed based on patient demand. Taking patients for CAR-T as example, 
doctors from different departments will take part in the treatment to offer support whenever there is a demand.
 We also give mental support to give patients the best experience," she said.
