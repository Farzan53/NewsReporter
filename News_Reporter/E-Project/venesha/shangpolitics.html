        <h3>Shanghai Disney: Visitors unable to leave without negative Covid test as park shuts</h3>
        
        <p> Shanghai Disney has become the latest high-profile venue to shut its gates thanks to China's strict
zero-Covid policy, trapping visitors inside. People have been told they will not be allowed out of
the theme park until they can show a negative test. It comes after Shanghai reported 10 locally
transmitted cases on Saturday. China's controversial zero-Covid policy has already seen millions
of people repeatedly locked down, sometimes in unusual locations. The sudden nature lockdowns 
have seen people fleeing shops - including a Shanghai branch of Swedish furniture giant Ikea - 
and workplaces as they try to avoid being trapped inside. However, those awaiting their freedom
at Shanghai Disney can console themselves with one positive: rides are continuing to operate for
those trapped inside The Happiest Place on Earth. As well as the theme park, surrounding areas 
such as the shopping street were also abruptly closed shortly after 11:30 local time (3:30 GMT).  
Videos posted on Chinese social media site Weibo showed people rushing to the park's gates following the
 announcement but finding them already locked. Posting on Chinese social media site WeChat, the Shanghai
 government said the park was barring people from entering and those inside could only leave once they had
  returned a negative test result. It added that anyone who has visited the park since Thursday must provide 
  three negative test results over three consecutive days. No date has been given for when the park will reopen.
   Shanghai Disney said tickets will be valid for six months and refunds will be given. The snap closure comes
just two days after the park began operating at a reduced capacity to comply with Covid measures. It's not 
the first time the park has unexpectedly shut. Last November, 30,000 people were trapped inside after 
authorities ordered everyone to be tested as part of contact tracing. Almost three years since China 
reported its first coronavirus case, authorities across the vast nation continue to impose abrupt and 
extreme measures in a bid to stop any transmission of the virus. Millions of people are under 200 different
lockdowns in China, as of October 24, as the country of 1.45 billion consistently records more than 1,000
new Covid cases a day. The numbers are seen as relatively small outbreaks in other parts of the world.
However, earlier this month Chinese President Xi Jinping signalled that there would be no easing up of
the zero-Covid policy - which aims to wipe out all outbreaks - calling it a "people's war to stop the 
spread of the virus". The Chinese government's insistence on the increasingly unpopular policy comes 
as the economy continues to take a hit as a result, with GDP falling by 2.6% in the three months to the
end of June from the previous quarter.

        <h3>Authorities in Shanghai crack down on Halloween celebrations</h3>
        <p> In Shanghai, police, not trick-or-treaters and partygoers, are taking to the streets this week as the city
             approaches Halloween. The strengthened police force accompanies official notices prohibiting citizens from
              “role-playing” on Halloween, signaling the government’s paranoia over the social instability the holiday’s
               festivities could bring.
            Videos online show police cars lining the streets of Shanghai, with some officers approaching crowds and 
            instructing them to disperse from fenced-off areas.    
            A leaked notice from the Huangpu subdistrict office identified any form of Halloween costumes, but 
            especially role-playing costumes and makeup with gore, to be prohibited in public. Police have been 
            instructed to persuade those in costume to leave or take off offensive garments and employ more coercive
             measures in the event of noncompliance.   
            The police garrisons, protocols and general air of malaise in Shanghai find their roots in the local 
            government’s fear of mass protest, according to Shanghai resident Ma, who declined to provide her first
             name out of fear of reprisal for talking to VOA.
            “The Communist Party knows that 'a spark can start a prairie fire' and that many young people are now 
            unemployed and unable to find jobs,” Ma siad. “So they have deployed a large number of police forces on 
            Changle Road and Julu Road, probably because they are worried that some of the freethinking young people
             will protest against the government in a strange way on Halloween.” Ma told VOA. 
            Costumed people taken by police
            Some youth in Shanghai have appeared to ignore the warnings, gathering in Zhongshan park and the nearby 
            streets to celebrate the holiday early. Online videos of the scene show some people in costume being taken
             away by the police, while others argue with law enforcement.   
            At another celebration Friday night, in the Jing An district, Reuters reported that an attendee in a 
            skeleton costume was detained by the police and escorted to an administrative building where he was asked 
            to remove his makeup.   
            Wang, a Shanghai resident who declined to provide his first name for his personal security, disagreed with
             the sudden tightening of restrictions on Halloween celebrations in his city.   
            "What can wearing a unique dress do?” Wang asked. “As a normal, civilized society, this should not be a 
            matter of concern at all. It is normal to ‘let the arts blossom’ and allow everyone to release their inner
             yearning for freedom. In a normal, civilized society, the police maintain the safety of the people. In
              our case, it's the opposite,” Wang said.   
            Originating in the West, Halloween has found popularity in China in recent years. This is especially the 
            case in Shanghai, known as China’s most international city and for its relative open-mindedness.

        <h3>Permits rejected for 10 Chinese participants of Taipei-Shanghai forum</h3>         
        <p>Ten members of a Shanghai delegation had their permits rejected to visit Taipei for the Taipei-Shanghai
Twin City Forum starting on Tuesday next week, including that of Shanghai Municipal Taiwan Affairs 
Office Director Jin Mei (金梅) and nine media personnel, the Taipei City Government said today.
The city received news last night that of the 102 members of the Shanghai delegation led by Shanghai 
Vice Mayor Hua Yuan (華源), intended to land in Taiwan on Monday, only 92 have received permits, Taipei
City Government spokesperson Yin Wei (殷瑋) told reporters.       
Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an's (蔣萬安) delegation to Shanghai last year was permitted to visit China for
the event, so the city government hopes that Taiwan could afford the same treatment to the Shanghai delegation
 this year, he said. 
 If the central government decides members of the delegation cannot visit the country, they should provide a 
 good reason, Yin said.
Taiwanese have faith in the nation’s democratic tenacity and support a free press, but Chinese media are often
 barred from visiting Taiwan to the regret of the Taipei City Government, Yin said.
Additionally, the Mainland Affairs Council on Wednesday said that if China’s pressure on Taiwan continued to 
escalate, it could call to delay the forum at any time, while the Executive Yuan said yesterday that the
 decision would take into account a multitude of factors in deciding whether cross-strait tensions have 
 intensified, Yin added.
In response, the council said that the central government considered each member's relevance, professional 
capability and necessity in visiting the forum.
It also took into account the overall state of cross-strait tensions, including the Chinese Communist Party’s
 increased military drills near Taiwan and the continued exclusion of Taiwan in international bodies, the
  council said.
This year, China issued a 22-point set of “guidelines” to penalize Taiwanese independence separatists — 
including the death penalty — among other extreme and hostile measures that impacted cross-strait relations 
and created safety risks for Taiwanese visiting China, it said.
Attendance of the media personnel in question was judged to be unnecessary, as eight media groups and 12 media
 personnel from China had already received permission to conduct interviews in Taiwan, it added.
Separately, Democratic Progressive Party Taipei City Councilor Lin Yen-fong (林延鳳) said that in future budget
 reviews, councilors would not rule out a proviso for the city government to stop hosting the forums with 
 Shanghai and instead arrange forums with other international cities.
In response, Yin said that Taipei City Government’s exchanges with Shanghai and other international cities are
 not mutually exclusive.

<h1>SCO Summit: EAM S Jaishankar to arrive in Pakistan today to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. What’s on platter?</h1>
<p>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is set to arrive in Pakistan on Tuesday to participate in a Shanghai 
    Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conclave. This marks the first high-level visit by an Indian foreign 
    minister to Pakistan in nearly nine years amidst ongoing tensions between the neighbouring countries.
    On Monday, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang to discuss bilateral 
    relations and mutual interests. Several agreements were signed during their discussions, and they virtually
     inaugurated the Beijing-funded Gwadar airport.
     According to state-run Radio Pakistan, the delegation-level meeting reflected the leaders' satisfaction
      with the strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China, grounded in mutual trust and 
      shared principles.
      hey exchanged views on a wide range of bilateral, regional, and international issues, reaffirming their 
      support for each other on core matters and committing to high-quality development.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will attend a reception hosted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz 
Sharif for delegates from SCO member nations. However, during the SCO heads of government summit, both sides 
have ruled out any bilateral talks between Jaishankar and his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar.
This visit marks the first time in nearly nine years that an Indian Foreign Minister has travelled to Pakistan,
 despite ongoing tensions over the Kashmir issue and cross-border terrorism linked to Pakistan. Jaishankar is
  expected to stay in Pakistan for less than 24 hours.
