        <h3>Shanghai institutions help talent development</h3>
        <p>efore Deng Minghao's first visit to the Shanghai Chess and Cards Culture Museum in 2019, Go chess 
was merely a pastime for the quiet five-year-old boy with a penchant for mathematics. He used to spend around 
an hour each week at the Go club near his home, playing the game. Upon viewing exhibits, such as old photos,
 manuscripts, trophies and medals, showcasing the illustrious path of legendary Go player Chen Zude and other 
 influential Chinese players, Deng was inspired. "Before, I didn't care much about winning or losing a game, I
  thought playing Go was just for fun." "That museum visit made me want to win championships and experience
   that sense of honor," Deng recalls. Fortunately, on that day, the guide who led him through the museum 
   learned of his interest in Go, and recommended that he pursue more systematic learning of the game at the 
   more professional Putuo Chess Academy. Since then, a hobby has transformed into Deng's passion, with him
    becoming a regular at the academy. The Shanghai Chess and Cards Culture Museum, established in 2018, was
    designated in January 2023 by the General Administration of Sports and the Ministry of Science and 
    Technology as one of the country's first national sports science popularization bases. In addition to 
    housing a precious collection of Go artifacts and related ancient texts from numerous dynasties, the
     museum also features interactive touch screens and robots, through which visitors can experience the 
     challenge of playing against artificial intelligence. "We are currently planning to upgrade these 
     high-tech installations. The museum has been collaborating with different youth science and technology
     initiatives in Shanghai to provide children who may be interested in chess and cards with the opportunity
     to gain a deeper understanding of these mind games," says Zhou Shiyu, the museum director. Additionally,
      the museum regularly hosts public lectures, where children interested in Go can receive guidance from
       professional players. Deng was among the beneficiaries of these lectures. In July, the now 10-year-old 
       Deng won the men's championship in a local Go competition, in which more than 1,500 young players
        participated. "This was the happiest thing for me this summer!" </p>

        <h3>Sinner to face Medvedev in Shanghai Masters quarter-finals</h3>
        <p>World number one Jannik Sinner will face Daniil Medvedev in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals after both 
had straight-set victories on Wednesday.
Sinner put some old demons to rest in overcoming American Ben Shelton 6-4, 7-6 (7/1), while Medvedev took
out Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.   
Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic also progressed to the next round after comfortable wins.   
But world number three Alexander Zverev is out after losing to 66th ranked David Goffin 6-4, 7-5.  
Shelton, ranked 16, knocked Sinner out at the same stage last year but the Italian looked confident from
the start and won in 88 minutes.   
The US Open champion pulled ahead in the ninth game of the first set, breaking when Shelton hit long, then
dominated the second set tiebreak.    
World number five Medvedev and Tsitsipas were meeting for the 14th time.    
The Greek started the second set strong, breaking in the first game, but Medvedev broke in the fourth and
eighth to claim victory.    
Medvedev and Sinner have already met four times in the final stages of tournaments this year.   
Sinner beat Medvedev in the semi-finals in Miami, the quarter-finals of the US Open and in the Australian 
Open final, but the Russian ended the Italian's hopes in the last eight at Wimbledon in an epic five-set 
battle.   
"I'm gonna bring the fight," Medvedev said.   
"I could have done much better in the US Open... I didn't explore enough my potential during this match. 
So I'm going to try to explore this potential tomorrow," he said.   
Sinner said: "We know each other quite well now, we know exactly what to expect, more or less.    
"Of course, it's going to be a very tough match, physical match, mental match, and also tactical, so let's 
see what's coming."

        <h3>Nike finds inspiration from Shanghai’s night runners </h3>         
        <p> For Seema Simmons, Nike’s vice-president of Global Women’s Running & Fitness, a recent night out
with the Shanghai Night Run Club illuminated just how deeply running has taken root in China.
From seven-year-olds to 70-somethings, runners of all ages and backgrounds gathered in the city’s 
iconic nongtangs (alleyways) to run under the evening lights, a proof of the growing appeal of the
sport across China, Simmons said.           
“Seeing so many people running after a long day of work is inspiring,” she said.           
“In the United States, you don’t see such scale of running at night. The passion here shows that
running is becoming a part of daily life, and it’s thrilling for us to be part of that story.”           
Her time with the local running club was a reminder of how communities shape the sport — and of 
Nike’s commitment to supporting them as they chase their goals, she added.           
As running continues to gain momentum in China, Nike is evolving its strategy to lead this growth 
by investing in its key sports.
At the 7th China International Import Expo, Nike showcased its latest innovations, with Simmons 
emphasizing the specific role of Chinese women in driving the sport’s growth.
“Globally, we are seeing increasing participation in running and specifically of women,” she said.
About 70 percent of the research in the Nike Sports Research Lab focuses on women. Women help provide more
 intuitive and actionable insights for their creation process, Simmons said.
“In China, women are not just looking for high-performance features such as maximum cushioning but also 
prioritize style,” she said. “They love taking their selfies after a race.”           
This focus on running is part of Nike’s long-term vision for China, according to Dong Wei, chairman and CEO of
 Nike Greater China.           
“Running has always been a core focus for Nike, and the potential in China is extraordinary,” Dong
said.           
“We’re doubling down on our investment in running here, aiming to lead the Chinese running industry
with products and experiences built around the needs of Chinese runners.”
The company opened its first Sports Research Lab Form accessible to everyday consumers at the Nike Shanghai 
Brand Experience Store.
China is the first market to offer this service at retail.
There, local runners can access advanced biomechanics testing to better understand their performance and
 receive recommendations tailored to their bodies and goals.

<h1>Virtual sports' popularity spreads from Shanghai to the world</h1>
<p> Virtual sports, which began in Shanghai and now involve participants from all across the country and abroad,
     have grown in popularity due to their distinct features and appeal.
    Over 130 players competed in the three disciplines of cycling, rowing, and motor racing at the Grand Final 
    of the Meta SVS 2024 Shanghai Virtual Sports Open, which took place at the Shanghai 1353 Conference Center.
    "There are so many brilliant Chinese rowers out there," said Michael James Slotema, an international student
     from Britain. Slotema was representing the Wycombe Abbey School Team from Changzhou, Jiangsu Province.
    WAS, along with five other teams representing international schools in Shanghai and nearby regions, competed
     in three rounds of online contests before reaching the Grand Final in Shanghai.
     "Through virtual sports, I was able to compete with schools in Shanghai and the surrounding area while 
     still in Changzhou," said Slotema. "This can really help build a strong community of schools together in 
     the region."
The Virtual Sports Open began in April and ran for nine months. In addition to retaining last year's five major
 events of rowing, cycling, motor racing, skiing, and golf, it added virtual skipping, spinning, and EA FC, 
 involving over 130,000 players from 10 countries and regions, including China, Singapore, Japan, the United
  Kingdom, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, the United States, and Russia.
  Aside from breaking down geographic barriers between participants from diverse locations, virtual sports 
  engage with other online and offline competitions.
The Shanghai Virtual Sports Open expanded to include the eSports FC Pro Champions Cup in August.
In September, 35 cyclists from a virtual cycling qualification competed in the Nanhui session of the 2024 Tour
 of Shanghai New Cities. Three of them made it to the podium.
 According to organizer Juss Intellisports, the Shanghai Virtual Sports Open will hold more online-plus-offline
  tournaments in 2025, covering popular events such as rowing, cycling, and skiing.
 "The selection of our sports items matches the interests of young people," said Zhang Jiyue, Shanghai Virtual
  Sports Open's event director.
 "The purpose is to attract more youngsters and encourage more people into practicing sports by helping them 
 beat location restrictions and connect with each other," he added.
