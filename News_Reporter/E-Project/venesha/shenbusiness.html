        <h3>SZ's first-store economy on fast track</h3>
        <p>Shenzhen's first-store economy continues to thrive, with 165 new first stores opening in the third
quarter of 2024, a 13% year-on-year increase and the highest quarterly total since 2018. The 
first-store economy refers to new store openings — especially initial or flagship locations — by
global or trendy brands within a defined geographic market. It serves as a barometer of the
local business environment and spending power. According to statistics from Winshang.com, a
leading marketing platform in the retail commerce sector, by the end of September, Shenzhen 
had welcomed 336 new first stores this year, a 26% increase compared to 2023. Many of these 
stores have introduced innovative experiences to local customers, bringing fresh energy to the
city's retail sector, a Shenzhen Special Zone Daily report said yesterday. The new first
stores were predominantly in the catering, retail, life services, cultural, sports, and
entertainment sectors. Among those opened in the first nine months, 22 were the first in 
the country, representing 13% of the total. Fifty-eight of them, or 35%, were the first in 
South China, and 52%, or 85 stores, were the first in the city. Shenzhen has become the 
first stop for more and more international brands entering the South China market. Data 
shows that in the first three quarters of this year, Shenzhen has seen the opening of 69
first stores by international brands. In the third quarter alone, brands from 14 countries
opened 35 first stores. These international first stores are mainly concentrated in
categories such as clothing and fashion, with high-end and luxury brands accounting for 
80%. The Futian CBD remained the most popular area for first stores. Shenzhen High-tech Industrial Park in 
Nanshan District came in second. In recent years, Shenzhen has implemented a series of initiatives aimed at
 positioning the city as a premier destination for high-end brands targeting the local market. Data from 
 Winshang.com reveals that since 2022, Shenzhen has seen over 1,000 new first stores open, placing it second 
 only to Shanghai among China's four top-tier cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. </p>

        <h3>Investing in Shenzhen: Industry, Economics, and Policy</h3>
        <p>Often dubbed China’s Silicon Valley, Shenzhen is China’s fastest-growing city. It is ranked by the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences as the mainland’s top city for “overall economic competitiveness” and is 
China’s premier Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for foreign investment as well as a sub-provincial class city. 
Shenzhen was declared China’s first SEZ by then-Communist Party (CCP) chairman Deng Xiaoping in 
1979. Aided by capital flowing easily from neighboring Hong Kong, the city has since transformed 
from a small fishing town to a bustling megacity.            
Every year, millions flock to its city center as part-time or migrant workers, entrepreneurs from around the 
globe seek to benefit from its investment-friendly practices, and tourists admire its futuristic landscape.          
Located in Guangdong province only 100 km (62 miles) southeast of its capital, Guangzhou, Shenzhen
is strategically located on the Pearl River Delta that serves as a border with Hong Kong. The city center is 
under 20 minutes from Kowloon by fast train. Other nearby cities include Zhongshan, Dongguan, and Foshan.          
 2021 economic overview 
Shenzhen is China’s third-largest city by GDP after Shanghai and Beijing. GDP in 2021 surpassed the RMB 3
 trillion mark, up 6.7 percent from the previous year. This is a significant recovery from the 3.1 percent
  year-on-year growth in 2020. Shenzhen also has the highest per capita of any city in China, reaching RMB
   173,663 (US$25,889) in 2021. 
   Shenzhen is a service-driven economy, with the tertiary sector accounting for almost 63 percent of GDP. 
   Manufacturing nonetheless remains an important mainstay industry, accounting for almost all of the 
   remaining value-add to GDP. 
According to the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), Shenzhen 
is one of four core cities to serve as the engines for development in the region. Shenzhen is frequently 
called upon to be the GBA’s technology and R&D hub. As of 2018, four percent of Shenzhen’s GDP was invested in
 research and over 11,000 high-tech enterprises called the city home.

        <h3>Abu Dhabi and Shenzhen sign Twin City agreement  </h3>         
        <p>UAE capital Abu Dhabi and China’s Shenzhen have signed a Twin City agreement, under which both
parties will share knowledge and collaborate on smart city projects across multiple areas.  
These include infrastructure, city planning, green mobility, transportation, advanced technology, autonomous 
solutions, sustainability, and urban development.
Situated in the southeastern part of China, Shenzhen is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. It had
 a population of 17.5 million in 2020 and is widely regarded as one of the most technologically advanced in
  the world in terms of infrastructure.
The agreement was signed during the inaugural Abu Dhabi x Shenzhen Innovation Forum (ADSZIF) held in Shenzhen.

  Mayor of Shenzhen, were the signatories. 
Al Shorafa said: “Abu Dhabi has its sights firmly set on being a global pioneer in sustainable and smart urban
 development. We are committed to leveraging innovation and technology to transform urban living and improve
  the lives, well-being and experience of all those connected to the UAE capital and across the emirate.
“Leveraging strategic partnerships is key to delivering any ambitious vision and Shenzhen is one of the most 
advanced cities in the world. We are confident that the agreements signed during the forum will ensure our two
 world-class cities become even more attractive to citizens, visitors, businesses, and investors in the Year 
 of the Dragon and beyond.”
Weizhong added: “Shenzhen is delighted to sign the Twin City agreement with Abu Dhabi and looks forward to
 working directly with DMT to exchange ideas and collaborate on smart city strategy.

<h1>Aedas-Designed Huanggang Skyscraper Redefines The Shenzhen Urban Landscape</h1>

<p> Acting as the southern gateway to China and important node of GBA, Shenzhen is a modern metropolis located 
    immediately north of Hong Kong, bearing significance in steering the economic growth of both cities and
     creating a transportation hub that connects the communities. Standing at 247m tall, the Huanggang Port
     Headquarters is set to be the new landmark for the Shenzhen Technology and Innovation Park and Shenzhen 
     Hong Kong Cooperation Zone. 
    Drawing inspiration from the surrounding landscape and reflecting the regional characteristics, the design 
    is based on the imagery of stacking stones and rivers. A simple fluid architectural form is adopted which 
     signifies flowing water, while the cantilevered canopy at the tower’s entrance signifies the splashes. It 
     has adopted a ripple-like cascading form, echoing the overall shape of the tower. The vertical lines of
      the façade pour from the crown to the lobby, unifying the architectural language from top to bottom. 
      Visitors also get to experience an arrival experience of grandeur and warmth with the 13-metre tall, 
      light-filled lobby, which has utilised a transparent glass panel wall to bring vitality to the city as 
      the cornerstones of the GBA cities.   
    The plane design follows a rigorous and symmetrical geometric form. Through the superposition of four 
    circles, the façade has adopted round corners formed by four arcs, the building space is made regular and 
     efficient, optimising the landscape view and creating a vibrant architectural form to greet the city. 
     Dividing the lateral floorplan into four, the interior is flexible and offers 10-14 metres of office 
     depth, in order to cater for corporates of different sizes and needs. There are also some open offices 
     near the crown of the  building, which facilitates communication and interaction through the introduction 
     of indoor-outdoor spaces. The greenery-adorned sky lobbies and featured roof are destined for recreational
      use, allowing workers to connect and unwind, while enhancing the development’s aesthetics and porosity. 
      It also provides an active and vibrant towerscape, where workers may enjoy a panoramic view that
       overlooks the nearby superior landscape resources. 
     The design has achieved a high assembly rate that optimises construction resources and time. To create an
      environmentally-friendly tower, vertical fins have been adopted to provide sufficient shading, and low
       reflection energy-saving curtain wall panels to minimise our carbon footprint. The integrity of the
        tower’s appearance has been preserved through an integrated system of ventilation solutions, achieving 
        a low carbon design for the tower.  
     “Built based on the principles of ‘high quality’, ‘customisation’ and ‘sustainability’, we envision a 
     harmonious  layout of simple geometric shapes together formed by the tower and Huanggang Port, that 
     ontributes to the development of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Cooperation Zone,” says Chris.   
     Aedas is the world’s only local and global architecture and design practice driven by global sharing of
      research, local knowledge and international practice. Our 1,100 creative minds with design studios
       across the globe create world-class design solutions with deep social and cultural  understanding of 
       the communities we design for. We create world-class design solutions that are  tailored to the needs 
       of cities and communities around the world.
