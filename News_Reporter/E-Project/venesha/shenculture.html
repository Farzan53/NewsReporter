        <h3>Qianhai, Shenzhen Sees Cultural and Tourism Boom Fueled by Chinese Anime and New Developments
        </h3>
        <p>Qianhai, a vibrant district in Shenzhen, has become a cultural and tourism hotspot, drawing 
            attention thanks to the impact of the popular Chinese anime IP “Nailong” and the region’s new
infrastructure developments. During the recent Chinese National Day holiday, Qianhai transformed
into a must-visit destination, with more than a thousand social media posts related to “Qianhai 
and Nailong” garnering over 3 million views within just seven days. This surge in interest 
highlights Qianhai’s rising prominence as a cultural and tourism center. Following the opening
of the Shenzhen–Zhongshan Link in July, the region saw an influx of visitors eager to explore 
its newly developed attractions. Data from the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service
Industry Cooperation Zone Authority revealed that the Rainbow on the Sea Cruise Ship, which 
connects Qianhai with the Shenzhen–Zhongshan Link, attracted over 10,000 passengers in its 
first month of operation, with all daily sailings fully booked. This resulted in a 69% 
year-on-year increase in operating revenue. Expanding Infrastructure and Cultural Offerings
Qianhai’s appeal extends beyond its cultural and anime connections. The district boasts a 
68-kilometer golden coastline and comprehensive transportation and tourism resources. On                 
September 30, two key infrastructure projects were completed—the pedestrian landscape bridge at the mouth of 
the Shuangjie River and a cycling path connecting OH Bay with the Shuangjie River. These additions marked the 
full connectivity of the Qianhai Bay Slow Traffic Public Space, further enhancing the area’s tourism and 
cultural consumption potential. Qianhai has also been actively developing its services and facilities to 
foster cultural and economic growth. Early in 2024, Qianhai Uniway, an “urban central park mall,” officially
 opened, adding to the district’s appeal. In May, the Qianhai International Neighborhood launched, covering 
 65,000 square meters and becoming Shenzhen’s first high-standard international neighborhood. In addition, the
  recently operational Qianhai Chow Tai Fook Finance Tower has already drawn in several prominent merchants. </p>

        <h3>Shenzhen art museum opens exhibition showcasing work of MAD Architects  </h3>         
        <p>  Shenzhen Museum of Contemporary Art and Urban Planning has opened exhibition showcasing work of MAD Architects
            MAD Architects is led by Ma Yansong, Dang Qun and Yosuke Hayano
            The exhibition is the museum’s first solo exhibition of architecture since its opening in 2016
            The exhibition occupies an expansive space of more than 3,000sq m
Shenzhen Museum of Contemporary Art and Urban Planning (MoCAUP) has opened an exhibition which
provides a retrospective of the research and practices of MAD Architects.            
Called Ma Yansong: Landscapes in Motion, the exhibition occupies an expansive space of more than 3,000sq m and
takes visitors on a journey through 52 projects spanning almost two decades.        
MAD Architects is led by Ma Yansong, Dang Qun and Yosuke Hayano.
The exhibition is the MoCAUP’s first solo exhibition of architecture since opening in 2016.
There are four separate, but connected, sections to the exhibition.            
It commences with a thought-provoking introduction, which features more than 180 questions, posed by current
 and previous architects working for MAD.
The questions touch on topics related to urban development, architecture, daily life, the role of architects,
 the future and dreams.
This is followed by section one, called “Dialogue,” which presents seven of MAD's urban public 
projects, such as the Shenzhen Bay Culture Park and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.
The other sections are “Progress,” showcasing MAD projects which are either under construction or completed;
 “Feelings are Facts,” introducing 15 design and land art projects; and “Rhapsody,” which weaves together 12
  projects – such as Beijing 2050, Hutong Bubble, and Floating Island – to form a living rhapsody about the city.
Explaining the exhibition’s motif, Ma Yansong said: "Architecture and cities are not abstract scientific
technologies but real settings where life unfolds.
"They represent feelings, ambience, and time. They carry traits of living beings; thus they are full of energy, flow, dynamism, and uncertainty.
"Architecture is alive, growing with the earth, endowed with life, rich in emotions, perceptive of time and
 compassionate to everything.
"The goal of this exhibition is to use architecture as a conduit to explore cultural life, allowing us to
 probe our inner selves while observing the dynamic, diverse and fluid cultural landscape of contemporary
  society.”

<h1>Shenzhen awash in Dragon Boat Festival tradition and cheer</h1>
<p> Drizzly weather didn't put a damper on the enthusiasm of both paddlers and spectators at the dragon boat
     race in Nan'ao Subdistrict, Dapeng New Area on Friday. 
    Accompanied by rhythmic drumbeats and the spirited cheers of spectators, 12 teams took part in fierce 
    competitions to kick off the 2024 Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Shenzhen Nan'ao) Maritime
     Dragon Boat Race in the Yueliang Bay area.   
    A total of 30 teams from the Greater Bay Area engaged in competitions in the two-day race.         
    In its 20th edition since 1998, this competition distinguishes itself as the only dragon boat race held in 
    the sea off Shenzhen.     
   Among the 12 teams present Friday, the Hong Kong team shone brightly with a diverse international roster
    that included members from the U.K., South Korea, Japan, Moldova, and various other countries and regions.   
    For Tafadzwa Mackenzie Kadere, from the U.K., participating in the event for the second time was a 
    thrilling experience.     
    "The dragon boat racing community continues to grow every year. I've made numerous new friends from 
    Shenzhen and Guangzhou, particularly with members of a seasoned team that has already competed in dragon 
    boat races four times this year," Kadere said. 
    Daniel Martin, a fitness coach from the U.K., enthusiastically discussed his first time participating in a 
    marine dragon boat race. "Everyone was in high spirit. We had fun together," said Martin, who has competed 
    in many races elsewhere. "The water in Nan'ao is clear."  
    Martin said that the race underscores not just individual strength, but also the essential aspect of team 
    coordination. "It's more about pulling together as a team, maintaining a synchronized rhythm," Martin said.   
    Hoarse from cheering throughout the races, Deng Haipeng, leader of the Shenzhen Longhua Longxie team,
     shared his excitement. "I am absolutely thrilled! We have retained the championship this year," he said.  
    Deng stressed the importance of each team member and the essential need for seamless cooperation. 
    "Paddling in the sea differs notably from river racing because it requires extra strength to contend with
     the waves — a factor that sets it apart from our usual river training sessions. But the most important 
     factor is how we cooperate with each other," he said.
    In addition to the dragon boat race, the two-day event also featured captivating performances including 
    water surfing, a staged traditional fisherman's wedding ceremony, and straw dragon dancing. 
    Further cultural delights await those who visit Nan'ao to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, with food 
    stalls and entertainment offerings, such as pop songs and magic performances, at Yueliang Bay Square from 
    10 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day until tomorrow.    
    Across the city, several dragon boat races were held to mark the Dragon Boat Festival, which fell on
     yesterday this year
    Origin of Dragon Boat Festival  
    With a history of more than 2,000 years, the Dragon Boat Festival, also known as the Duanwu Festival, 
    falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, which was yesterday this year. The festival has a rich
     cultural background with several legends.
    It is said that in 278 B.C., Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet and a senior official in the state of Chu, faced 
    with the pain of national subjugation, threw himself into the Miluo River on the fifth day of May. 
    In order to prevent fish and other aquatic organisms from damaging his body, people put bamboo tubes
     filled with rice into the river. Subsequently, in order to show their reverence and nostalgia for Qu,
      people threw bamboo tubes filled with rice into the river in his memory. This is the origin of the 
      earliest zongzi in China. After Qu jumped into the river, people rowed in boats to find his body, which
       gradually evolved into today's dragon boat races in southern China. In recent years, this activity has 
       crossed national boundaries and won attention overseas. The festival was the first in China to be 
       listed as a human oral and intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO.
