        <h3>USC Price, Shenzhen Municipal Government Sign Letter of Intent</h3>
        <p>In an effort to further their existing institutional engagement, the USC Sol Price School of Public
Policy and the Organization Department of the Shenzhen (China) Municipal Committee signed a letter
of intent on Sept. 4 to enhance exchanges and explore new forms of mutually beneficial 
cooperation. Faculty and administrators from USC and the Price School were in attendance to host
the delegation of senior government officials, which was led by Dai Beifang, head of Shenzhen’s
Communist Party human resources department and the president of the Communist Party University.
Since 2006, the Price School has provided continuing education and civil service training 
programs for high-ranking public servants from Shenzhen in key subject areas such as public
management and governance. In total, USC Price has held six training programs, most recently
on Sept. 24.USC Price Dean Jack Knott opened the visit, welcoming the delegation and 
expressing his enthusiasm to advance collaboration between the two institutions. “The Price 
School strongly values the opportunity to work with high-ranking civil servants from 
Shenzhen — to exchange ideas and to share our research and knowledge on critical issues involving economic 
development, social construction, governance and public administration,” said Knott, who signed the letter of
 intent on behalf of USC Price. Other speakers from USC included: Anthony Bailey, interim vice provost for 
 global initiatives, who spoke about the university’s global initiatives and specifically its engagement in 
 China; and Joanna Yu, project director of the USC-Shenzhen collaboration. Additionally, in spring 2011, 24
  Price graduate students, led by Senior Fellow Mark Pisano, collaborated with the Shenzhen Public 
  Administration Institute on the Price School’s international lab. Together, they worked closely with
   Shenzhen faculty on industry innovation to raise the air quality in the Pearl River Delta area. The Price 
   students stayed in Shenzhen for two weeks to conduct the field study, receiving support with data and
    instruction from their Shenzhen colleagues. Several papers were published as a result of their collective 
    work. </p>

        <h3>13 missing in southern China’s Shenzhen after railway building site collapse</h3>
        <p> A catastrophic collapse at a construction site alongside a high-speed railway line in China’s 
southern tech hub of Shenzhen late on Wednesday night has left 13 people missing.
The ground gave way at around 11pm on a section of the Shenzhen-Jiangmen railway in Baoan 
district’s Hangcheng Street area. The line connects seven stations, including Dongguan, Guangzhou,
Zhongshan and Jiangmen.          
Immediate emergency response measures were initiated, with provincial and city leaders rushing to the site,
 according to authorities.
 Construction, traffic management, and emergency services were working tirelessly to locate the missing
  workers, they said. Local fire and rescue services sent 48 vehicles and 198 personnel to the scene.
The authorities said residents in the area were evacuated promptly and temporary traffic control measures were
 in place.
The cause of the collapse is under investigation.
The Ministry of Emergency Management sent a work team to the site to guide the rescue efforts, stressing the 
need for a scientific approach to prevent further accidents.
Guangdong Communist Party chief Huang Kunming and governor Wang Weizhong arrived at the site early on Thursday
 to coordinate emergency operations, according to media reports.

        <h3>Shenzhen accelerates steps in opening up</h3>
        <p> As we reflect on 2024, Shenzhen remains committed to advancing high-level opening up, actively 
integrating into the new development pattern, and attracting foreign investment. Starting today, Shenzhen Daily
 and EyeShenzhen will launch "2024 in Review," a special series highlighting the city's progress across
  various fields.
  Shenzhen's foreign trade has surpassed 4 trillion yuan for the first time, with exports expected to lead 
  among mainland cities for the 32nd consecutive year.
From January to November, the city's foreign trade reached 4.1 trillion yuan, an increase of 17.4% year on
 year. Imports amounted to 1.5 trillion yuan, up 19.8%, while exports reached 2.6 trillion yuan, increasing by 16%. 
Cross-border e-commerce trade grew by 19%. Exports of BYD new energy vehicles reached 428,000 units, a 76% increase, 
reaching 90 countries or regions and 400 cities worldwide.
Shenzhen's 15 ports experienced a surge in passenger and freight flows, with its 11 passenger ports handling a
 total of 240 million trips across the border in 2024, a 45.6% increase year on year. 
All the passenger ports implemented visa-free transit for overseas visitors. Throughout the year, Shenzhen had
 seen 5.4 million overseas visitors exiting and entering the city, an 89.3% increase year on year. Among them,
  2.76 million were inbound visitors, doubling from the previous year. The city opened 19 new international 
  and regional air cargo routes in 2024. Its network, totaling 89 routes, connects to 63 cities worldwide.
The Shenzhen airport handled a total of 61.47 million passenger trips, a 16.6% year-on-year increase, with

 relationship with Shenzhen each, bringing the total number to 95. The number of sister ports increased to 28,

<h1>World’s first Intl. Mangrove Center established in Shenzhen</h1>    
<p>The world’s first International Mangrove Center (IMC) was officially established in Shenzhen on Nov. 6,
    with representatives from the first batch of 18 member countries jointly signing an agreement on its 
    establishment.
    Adapted to living in salt and brackish water, mangroves are found along coasts and estuaries in 123
    countries in the tropics and subtropics, according to the U.N. Environment Program. Mangrove forests
     provide protection against storms, erosion, and flooding, improve water quality, offer natural habitats
      to over 1,500 species, and benefit adjacent ecosystems such as coral reefs.
Official data show that Shenzhen has 36,100 hectares of wetlands. Mangroves cover 296 hectares, and 61% of the
 wetlands have been designated as protected conservation areas. In the past two years, Shenzhen has created
  15.48 hectares of mangrove forests and restored 103 hectares of existing mangrove forests.
The Futian Mangrove National Nature Reserve stands as the world’s only untouched urban wetland situated in the
 heart of a city. The wetland and Hong Kong’s Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site form crucial stopovers sites 
 for migratory birds.
China’s proposal for the establishment of the IMC in Shenzhen was approved by the Standing Committee of the
 Ramsar Convention at its 62nd meeting in Geneva in September last year.
The center, an important platform for promoting mangrove exchanges and international cooperation, will 
establish a global cooperation mechanism for mangroves and coastal blue carbon ecosystems characterized by 
openness, inclusiveness, co-building, sharing, and win-win cooperation.
