        <h3>MVRDV wins bid for Shenzhen Badminton Training Centre</h3>
        <p>MVRDV, together with co-architects Huayi Design, has been announced as the winner in the Shenzhen 
Pingshan Sports Park competition in Eastern Shenzhen. The proposed development will feature an 
arena for badminton and other sports, the newly proposed Shenzhen Badminton Training Centre, a 
National Fitness Center, a general sports park which is open to all, and various commercial 
facilities. Badminton is featured in the design of the complex, which has a total of 100 badminton
courts. The arena, the warmup, and the training courts are hosted in the main building of the
complex, through which a public promenade meanders to create a lively T-shaped central plaza. 
The plaza is the result of the “sweet spot” a name inspired by the perfect point on a badminton
racket for hitting the heart of the public space. A link space, at a level lower than the 
public ground, is ensconced between different sections of the National Training Centre, thus
providing space for the privacy of athletes while they move between spaces. This multi-layered
design makes for smooth integration of public areas, maintaining exclusively professional 
areas for athletes.  “Given the programme of the complex, it was clear that the Pingshan Sports Park should be
 a real celebration of all sports, but more than anything else, it should be a celebration of badminton”, says
  MVRDV founding partner Jacob van Rijs. “With the design of The Sweet Spot, we tackled that requirement
   head-on, with a fun and easily readable concept that anyone can appreciate.

        <p>Following a record-breaking 2024 event, the Billie Jean King Cup by Gainbridge Finals will be 
hosted in Shenzhen, China, from 2025 to 2027. 
This represents a significant milestone in the event’s history, reflecting its commitment to creating the
brightest, boldest, and most unifying platform for women’s tennis globally.          
With its state-of-the-art facilities, ever-growing tennis culture, and growing demand for women’s
sports, China offers an excellent setting to create unforgettable moments and showcase the brilliance of the
 world’s best women tennis players in an inspiring, electrifying environment.           
The Billie Jean King Cup continues to unite nations, celebrate her enduring legacy, and highlight the bold and
 empowering spirit of women’s tennis. Launched in 1963 as the Federation Cup with 16 nations, the tournament 
 has grown exponentially, with a record 146 nations set to compete in 2025.           
"The announcement of the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in Shenzhen demonstrates our commitment to bringing the 
passion and excitement of nation vs nation team tennis to markets around the world. Shenzhen embodies the 
spirit of growth and innovation that is at the core of the Billie Jean King Cup, expanding the reach of tennis and championing the power of women’s sports." – Billie Jean King.
The decision to host the Finals in China is part of the Billie Jean King Cup's broader goal, as a
global competition, to increase its reach and elevate the profile of women's tennis on a worldwide scale. The move also aligns with the tournament’s ambition to create moments of cultural exchange, celebrate differences, and build stronger connections between athletes and fans from diverse backgrounds.           
Zheng Qinwen, Paris 2024 gold medallist and current world number five, said: “Having the Billie Jean King Cup 
Finals in Shenzhen is a dream come true for myself and other Chinese tennis players.

        <h3>2021 LoL World Championship Finals heads to Shenzhen </h3>         
        <p>Riot Games planning multi-city competition after 2020 event was held in Shanghai bubble
LoL Worlds was most-watched esports tournament last year
The 2021 League of Legends (LoL) World Championship Finals will be held in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, the
 game’s developer Riot Games has announced.
It will be the second consecutive year that the esports tournament will crown its champion in China. Last year,
 the finals were held in Shanghai in front of a limited live audience due to Covid-19. Prior to the pandemic,
  the event was set to be staged at the 56,000-seater Shanghai Stadium, home of Chinese Super League (CSL)
   soccer club Shanghai SIPG FC.          
Study: T1 named China’s most popular overseas esports team
China has also hosted the final in 2017 at the Beijing National Stadium. For 2021, if health and safety 
regulations permit, the competition will travel to a variety of Chinese cities before finishing in Shenzhen.
 More host cities will be announced over the course of the year.  
 Last year’s Worlds, which were won by DAMWON Gaming, dominated esports’ viewership charts. According to
  figures released by Esports Charts, the tournament racked up 139.86 million hours watched, as well as 3.88
   million for peak viewership and 1.11 million for average viewership.

<h1>Shenzhen latest Chinese football club to fold under weight of past debt, refused license for 2024 season
</h1>

<p>Inaugural Chinese Super League (CSL) champions Shenzhen FC said on Monday it was folding with immediate
     effect, after failing to be granted a license for the upcoming season.
    Founded in 1994, Shenzhen FC became the first team to win all three professional divisions in China when 
    they won the CSL just 10 years later, in what turned out to be the club’s last league title.  
    The team endured turbulent times after the 2004 title win and never finished higher than 11th in the top
     division, until their relegation to China League One in 2011.
     They were eventually promoted back to the CSL in 2019 but finished rock bottom in 2023, and were relegated once more.
“According to the list of debt-clearing clubs announced by the Chinese Football Association, Shenzhen Football
 Club failed to pass the professional league’s admission for the 2024 season and cannot continue to compete in
  the professional football league,” a club statement said.
  The announcement of the club’s collapse comes a day after Cristiano Ronaldo and his Al Nassr side landed in 
  Shenzhen for two preseason friendlies, and less than a week after Dalian Pro also announced it would not be
   competing because of “historical debts that could not be resolved”.
