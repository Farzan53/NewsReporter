        <h3>SZ, Fosun Pharma launch health care fund in Pingshan  </h3>         
        <p> Shenzhen has teamed up with one of the country’s largest pharmaceutical producers to launch a 
5-billion-yuan (US$691 million) health care fund to invest in startups and innovations in cellular biology,
 genetics and other fields related to biomedicine. 
The Shenzhen Pengfu Biopharmaceutical Industry Private Equity Investment Fund was registered March 21 in
 Pingshan District. The business scope of the fund includes activities such as equity investment, investment
  management, and asset management conducted through private equity funds, the fund’s registration information
   shows.
The 5-billion-yuan fund is jointly funded by Shenzhen’s government-run guidance funds and social 
capital, with 70% of the money contributed by the guidance funds of the Shenzhen city government 
and the city’s six district governments and the rest coming from Fuxin Shenyao, a subsidiary 
indirectly controlled by pharmaceutical giant Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co. (Fosun Pharma), 
Fosun Pharma (Shenzhen) and Fujian Fund Management, two wholly owned subsidiaries of Fosun Pharma.          
In China, government guidance funds are an important funding source for the country’s private 
equity market, directing capital to the emerging strategic industries like semiconductors, health 
care and high-end manufacturing.         
The Shenzhen Pengfu fund will have a duration of 10 years and at least 70% of the fund will be
allocated to the biomedical industry, aligning with Shenzhen’s plan to develop the city into a 
health care manufacturing hub, according to an announcement by Fosun Pharma in March. Fuxin 
Shenyao will serve as the general partner of the fund and will oversee its day-to-day operations.           
The fund will aim to attract non-local enterprises to invest in biomedical firms in Shenzhen and
provide support to small and medium-sized enterprises in the city. It will also strive to obtain
the relevant approvals needed for clinical drug trials and registration certificates.            
Shenzhen has introduced a series of measures over the past two years to promote the development of the 
biomedicine and general health industries and the southern China city is expected to roll out more industrial
policies to support the sector. Official data unveiled by the Shenzhen government in December showed that the
 biopharmaceutical industry contributed 14 billion yuan to the city’s economy in the first three quarters of
  2023 and the city is home to 140 large biopharmaceutical firms, of which 11 are publicly listed, eight have
   revenues exceeding 1 billion yuan and four claim turnover of above 10 billion yuan.

    Shenzhen has taken significant steps to promote medical reforms and introduced innovative mechanisms to
     revamp its healthcare system, according to a city official at a press conference hosted by the National
      Health Commission in Shenzhen today. 
    The city has taken a pioneering role in the cancellation of drug markups and the centralized procurement 
    of drugs and medical consumables. These efforts have led to savings of 14 billion yuan (US$1.92 billion) 
    in procurement costs, said Chen Qing, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Shenzhen Municipal
     Committee. 
    Since the beginning of the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), Shenzhen has invested a total of 180.5 
    billion yuan in health finance, with an average annual growth rate of 11%, according to Chen. 
    “The city has established an investment guarantee mechanism for public hospitals, ensuring that all public 
    hospitals operate without debt,” Chen said.  
    He added that in 2023, personal health expenditure accounted for 16.2% of the city’s total health 
    expenditure, indicating that the burden of medical treatment on residents had been greatly reduced.
    Chen emphasized that Shenzhen has made a significant stride in advancing the internationalization of 
    China’s International Hospital Accreditation Standards, which were compiled by the Shenzhen Hospital Accreditation Research Center. 
    On Sunday, the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital became the first Hong Kong hospital to be 
    accredited under the standards, marking a key milestone in cross-border medical evaluation.   
    On the same day, the Shenzhen Hospital Accreditation Research Center Hong Kong Office was officially 
    opened, which will help expand China’s International Hospital Accreditation Standards to countries and 
    regions along the Belt and Road and around the world.
